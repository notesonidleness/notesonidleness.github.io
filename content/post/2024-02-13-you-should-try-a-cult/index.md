title: You Must Join a Cult
---

you need to join cult, trying multiple cult,

until you get cult with greatest sense of belonging

try to be diversed

then you realize the preach, we have to unite is a futile doctrine.

'i already content with this group'

the group has various numbers, it variance is big. even there's someone who content with only 1 number in group, 
even a half, even a quarter, even empty or void.

the idea of diversity is bullshit. 

those who dont find cult that they found complacent wont go anywhere

they become the cosmopoliton, dont belong to any cult

but once they find their cult, they are all shouting...

more isolation please!!!
