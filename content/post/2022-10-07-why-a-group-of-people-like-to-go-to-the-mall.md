title: Why a Group of People Like to Go to the Mall
---

You get paid as an employee. After you work you go the mall to enjoy your payment. This similar with some wall street ass in the dark period too, the difference is they go to the prostitution or gambling places. But who's hurting here? No one, except the jealous people who looks people can more enjoy the life itself. In it's substance, every aspect is just the same. 

You might think prostitution or gambling is bad. But that's a service they provide with effort. You might compare their effort with your effort or even with the poor effort to survive this world. It's irrelevant, like my writing too. Because the truth of relevant only exist in the some amounts of period. 

Like I don't want to follow something I can't enjoy. Human must pick their enjoyment. And for me, my enjoyment is fight with god, or the delusion that I make a fight with god. 

For me, the word arrogance itself should be removed from any dictionary. I mean, it's very temporary the definition of arrogant. When you died, how can you be an arrogant? Many people said we need to be grateful, but that's the same case with arrogant in a few perspective of people. 

Let's say you got friend or a perfect family, you share your story to everyone that you are grateful about. Or you visit an expensive restaurant, go around the world, by the fastest car in the world, fly with parachute, take a photo with komodo, etc etc you grateful about. 

For a jealousy people, your act it's a kind of an vanity, conceit, pride, arrogant. You make that jealousy people compare themself with you and make feel them miserable, or questioning their existence. Some of not jealousy people think that as a challenge, strive something the same, to keep their delusional social hierarchy. 

So it's never the fault of the cause. It's always the victim that makes everyone looks so bad. Good and bad, and any other adjective is so confusing. Confusing by myself is different with your ideas of confusing, and it might be the same too. 

So it's funny for me like when you're angry, when you're so called god being harassed by people. When there's a man who admit that he was a god, people like you angry at them and said they are arrogant. It's no different from the sycophants who are full of jealousy.

That's why, my enjoyment of delusional thoughts that I fight with god is never be a problem. 

To break something out of bounds, for anyone I think is complex, it is necessary to prove that it is complex or simple. So by resisting you will try to understand, understanding it may be a way of understanding yourself.

يٰٓاَيُّهَا الَّذِيْنَ اٰمَنُوْا لَا تُحَرِّمُوْا طَيِّبٰتِ مَآ اَحَلَّ اللّٰهُ لَكُمْ وَلَا تَعْتَدُوْا ۗاِنَّ اللّٰهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْمُعْتَدِيْنَ


يٰمَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالْاِنْسِ اِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ اَنْ تَنْفُذُوْا مِنْ اَقْطَارِ السَّمٰوٰتِ وَالْاَرْضِ فَانْفُذُوْاۗ لَا تَنْفُذُوْنَ اِلَّا بِسُلْطٰنٍۚ

We choose what we enjoy. Love or fight, I never realized there is love in every fight. So I am like drunkards, gamblers, and prostitutes. Because of love again I want to fight. Love of the known unknown.

And the adjective is actually dead. it's not that there's never been arrogance, but humans can't be arrogant. even if I try to fight, it exists only in the world of ideas and imagination, for anything physical never satisfies me.

So this is how I fight God.
