some media frame that is how the bomb terrorist school of thought, simplification, misinterpret, and whatnot. they said a simple claim with high variance could model the bigger picture. having sense a big objectivity, they turn some pictures and words to become their profit. 

anyone cant blame them because they want to be the top media companies, their employee need works to provide their kids at home. 

a lot big corpo, drill down to individual with overprice salary, they feel never enough, because they see whats coming for them, like what happened to nokia, blueberry, xerox, and so on.

there's always a room for change and improvement, except for the people you already hate.

its rare to see bromance like averroes and algazel this day. writing is often misinterpreted. seminars and debates are full of drama, too long and boring
