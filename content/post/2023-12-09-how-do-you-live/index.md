title: "Review How Do You Live"
---

the lesson learned from copper, uragawa, mizutani, kitami stories, and pram's works in general, is that it projects that your kids can only choose to become:

1. the bully,
2. the one who is being bullied,
3. and the one who only watches when a bullying event happens.

when you see land seized, genocide, warfare in a certain place, how lifeless technologies snatch jobs from luddites, the ignorance of workers who feel irreplaceable not engaging in long-term solutions to encourage capital owners to implement aspects of justice, poor-quality food, unsanitary living conditions, working day after day, galactic collisions, tidal interactions.

everything is nothing but a mere elementary school/kindergarten friendship bullying scene on a large scale, national-global, outer space level.

by the way, regret is a gift.

dulu ane sumpahin yg jelek2 buat yg nipu jual char LS, skrng justru ngerasa bersyukur pernah ditipu, akibatnya jd punya tingkat skeptical lumayan tinggi, walau minusnya ya sedikit trust issue. tapi ya sejauh ini gapernah ketipu ginian...
