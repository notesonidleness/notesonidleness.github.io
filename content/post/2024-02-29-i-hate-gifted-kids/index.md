title: I hate Gifted Kids
---

When you're a smartest person in your room, you realize you'll hate yourself because it means you're in the wrong room. You see news and hear speaks from other people that most of their smartest friend end up doing nothing compare to their most bastard friend. 

I saw reddit questions: What stopped you from killing yourself?

And here is my answer. 

I hate smart gifted kids as I hate older who see their smart gifted friends fail in life. 

I learn everyday to avoid become them. I don't want to be a book smart, to be a number one in academic. But it turned out my lust for recognition is higher than my ability to suppressed my desire. So I try everything I can to secure my position as someone who look smart in the number. And I knew it is all lie. You can easily manipulate everything in order to be number one. It's not the number one that you should aim, but rather in the process of searching that is matter. 

Thats why I hate it. I don't want to be like them. I need to find my way. I don't want any smartest kid in their room feel dismal because of their loneliness. I want them to feel that their loneliness is power. That loneliness that power them to create something. The anxiety that boost them to break the limit of everything so they can see what anyone can't see. It should be something that empower them to create something miracle monster. 

Thats why I need to remember my enemy. I don't desire friends. I desire enenmy, for they make me feel alive only to crush them. I need them more than my friends. I don't desire happiness. I desire revenge.
