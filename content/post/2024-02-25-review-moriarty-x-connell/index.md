i hate gay people.

no matter how i try to understand them, through watching movies, i just can't empathy with them.

i never relate, i can't understand how they process to have feeling for each other.

in sex scenes, i still find them disgusting.

i don't know maybe im just bias towards this because lightning stroke in my room at 1 AM right now.

maybe im just afraid of that lightning that makes me hate gay people.

- monster (2023): i find disappointment after i knew that it was a gay plot.
- call me by your name: gay scenes is disgusting, but the end dialog scenes with his father is comfortable to watch.
- blue is the warmest color. i cant relate to all of it because im a guy. but i tolerate the lesbian scenes.
- handmaiden: love it.
- The Perks of Being a Wallflower: i hate the gay kiss scenes.
- moonlight: somehow can relate with the isolation, but still hate the gay scenes. 

it's just gay is not my cup of tea. and yeah im pervert because i just like lesbian scenes.

maybe i just born with it, maybe i was born with hateful and resentment towards gay people as gay people born with feelings for the same sex that attract their attention.

maybe im just a hateful person.
