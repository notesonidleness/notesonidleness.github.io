title: Santet is Real

I always believe in mysticism because just because we can't see it, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

People might ask, if shamanism exists, why haven't they led or conquered the world?

Premise 1: There's always a cost in everything.

There's always a cost associated with everything. That's why practices like "santet" are usually found only in villages. If you observe areas far from the city, you'll notice that religious experiences differ greatly from those in urban areas. For example, South Korea has many cults that are far from the city.

I suspect this is because these practices are isolated from modernization and city life. The cost of performing "santet" is lower when the target or the environment doesn't pose significant barriers. If the target is small enough, the devil or Satan may still fulfill your expectations as long as you can afford the cost. However, when it comes to something bigger, such as political power in a major city, most individuals cannot afford that cost. As a result, we can see that many people in cities have never witnessed "santet" and don't even believe it exists.

Premise 2: Knowledge is as magical as "santet," and its impact can be greater.

Many philosophers understand that stories mentioned in religious texts are often metaphorical. Knowledge is power, and it can be considered a form of magic. With knowledge, you can accomplish almost anything. The story of Adam and Eve being expelled from heaven due to their curiosity highlights the connection between curiosity and the thirst for knowledge. In some religions, followers are encouraged to seek knowledge to better themselves, and there's often nothing wrong with that pursuit.

The problem arises when you search for knowledge, as you are unlikely to be satisfied with what you find. It perpetually keeps you searching and never fully satisfied. It's the tragedy of being human that curiosity can be both a blessing and a curse. The never-ending desire for knowledge can be painful, especially when you become consumed by it. Many erudite individuals who have lost their way often seek "the last knowledge."

What is this "last knowledge"? To me, it represents hell. The ultimate hypothetical question in both religion and science is, "Does hell exist?"

Conclusion: "Santet" loses power in certain aspects. Only knowledge can penetrate the barriers of limitation. Knowledge can be seen as a form of satanism. It is wise to be ignorant in some areas. However, if you don't pursue knowledge, it means you are willing to submit to some form of dictatorship.

Title: The Power Within: Unveiling the Mysteries of Knowledge and Mysticism

Once upon a time, in a world where unseen forces and hidden dimensions captured the human imagination, there was a firm believer in mysticism. This individual held the unwavering belief that just because something couldn't be seen, it didn't mean it didn't exist.

People would often question the existence of mystical practices like shamanism. "If it's real," they pondered, "why haven't the shamans conquered the world?" Our protagonist, with an air of wisdom, shared an intriguing perspective.

"In everything, there is always a cost," they said, their voice filled with certainty. Mystical practices like santet, known for its sorcery and enchantments, seemed to thrive in villages and remote areas, far from the bustling cities. The religious experiences in these places differed greatly from those in the urban centers. This observation led our protagonist to suspect that modernization and the urban lifestyle created barriers to mystical endeavors.

"Santet is cheaper and more potent when the target or environment lacks significant barriers," they explained. As the scope of one's ambitions increased, such as seeking political power in a metropolis, the cost to employ santet became prohibitively high. Thus, the enchanting powers of santet remained unseen by most city dwellers, leading to skepticism and disbelief in its existence.

But there was another force at play, something equally mesmerizing—knowledge. Our protagonist acknowledged that knowledge was as magical as santet, with the potential to wield greater influence. They shared a profound insight: "Knowledge is power, a form of magic that grants the ability to accomplish almost anything."

Drawing inspiration from ancient stories and religious texts, they emphasized that these narratives were often metaphors, pointing to the transformative power of knowledge. Curiosity, a driving force behind the quest for knowledge, held a dual nature. It was a gift that propelled individuals forward, but it also brought about their downfall.

They recalled the tale of Adam and Eve, whose curiosity led to their expulsion from heaven. Curiosity, it seemed, was both a blessing and a curse—a paradox of human existence. The tragedy lay in the insatiable thirst for knowledge, forever leaving one unsatisfied. Even the most erudite minds, yearning for that elusive "last knowledge," often succumbed to the despair of an eternal quest.

"What is this 'last knowledge'?" our protagonist mused. "To me, it represents a hellish enigma—a hypothetical question that intertwines religion and science. What kind of hell awaits those who possess the ultimate knowledge?"

In their contemplations, our protagonist recognized that mysticism, with its practices like santet, paled in comparison to the boundless potential of knowledge. Only knowledge had the power to transcend barriers and limitations. They likened the pursuit of knowledge to an act of satanism—a rebellion against constraints.

However, they warned that forsaking the pursuit of knowledge left individuals vulnerable to the chains of ignorance and at the mercy of dictatorial forces. The choice to embrace knowledge empowered individuals to shape their destinies, dismantling the shackles that mysticism imposed.

And so, our story comes to a close, with the recognition that mysticism, while captivating, thrives on belief alone. Meanwhile, knowledge illuminates the path to self-discovery and self-mastery, enabling individuals to become architects of their own fate. The unseen forces of mysticism may hold allure, but it is the power within—the power of knowledge—that ultimately unlocks the greatest mysteries of our existence.
