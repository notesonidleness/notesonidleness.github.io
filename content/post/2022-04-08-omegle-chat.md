title: Omegle Chat in Ramadhan
---

```
Cant sleep after sahur and wtf this satan is doing. They said satan is not shown up during Ramadhan. 
But I thought it is proven that I am the satan, after all this time. 
On the internet you can be anything you want. I should've just read quran and pray, but dunno this morning I just mad about OmeTV.

I was trying to learn english, speaking especially. But ffffff only Indonesian there. 
When I check there's an international guy, it turns out that most of them just horny guys and doesn't wanna talk except I am a girl. 
I tried VPN and still not work, maybe thats because its because free. 
I'm a computer science student, 6th semester, but still dont know the concept of VPN and dont want to learn. 
I feel so bad, why am I still detected as Indonesian, I want to learn pleasssssseeeee.
And I was giving up livestreaming. 

So I just tried chatting in omegle. 
When you said you are "M", the other side always just skip you or some OF girls promote their scam link to you. 
SO I tried to claim that I'm an "F".
With the failure of speaking with international people or Indonesian who speak english at Ometv, my mood is ruined.
Maybe that day my fast is just meaningless. 
Dont care and that day I just tryin to act like a doomer psycho girl lol.
Bruh why he really trust that I'm a woman, dunno. I enjoyed it.
My Ramadhan is ruined, astagfirullah.

If im not wrong, it was at approximately at 5 AM when this convo happened...
