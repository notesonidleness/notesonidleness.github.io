title: "From Scarcity to Abundance, Culture of Competition and Imitation"

We are constantly engaged in competition, but often it yields no real value.

Our actions are driven by jealousy and the instinct for survival, echoing Peter Thiel's statement that "Competition is for losers." In my opinion, true innovation cannot be achieved by simply imitating others.

Many educational institutions imitate one another, driven by the fear of missing out on certain organizations or events. Peer pressure pushes individuals to compete in embellishing their resumes with extravagant experiences and internships.

Some strive for material success, toiling day after day, only to realize that it fails to fulfill their genuine needs and desires. This phenomenon is known as the arrival fallacy.

People often act or pretend to act without the courage to reflect on their actions and make decisions based on thoughtful introspection. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."

This behavior is quite understandable, as individuals often believe they are inadequate and lack a sense of security.

Be cautious of those who appear successful and encourage you to take more risks and step out of your comfort zone. Their advice may be biased due to survivorship bias, assuming that others can replicate their success through similar paths.

Some argue that competition stems from economic scarcity, making it appear natural. However, I believe we can still experiment with alternative approaches.

The idea of a "Star Trek economy" is often dismissed as a delusion. Yet, what concerns me more is the lack of opportunities for the lower classes to access food and education safely. If the wealth gap hinders these opportunities, then we must take action to reduce inequality.

Critics argue that implementing a concept like Universal Basic Income (UBI) could foster laziness and decrease productivity. This hypothesis needs to be tested.

My hypothesis, inspired by McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y, suggests that people's behavior can be clustered into different groups. If a particular group becomes lazy when provided with free incentives, it indicates that we should either lower the incentives or introduce constructive punishments. By punishment, I mean a means of reflection that helps individuals become more mindful of their actions.

There are other groups that possess immense potential. My hypothesis suggests that if these groups have a margin of safety, they can focus on pursuing their true passions, fostering innovation, and creating solutions that benefit themselves and others. Instead of solely pursuing high-paying or high-status jobs for personal gain, they can solve problems, optimize existing systems, and create employment opportunities.

However, it is essential to consider how we measure right and wrong in evaluating the outcomes of providing free incentives. Artistic pursuits, such as producing content, movies, music, or paintings, are deeply desired by many individuals.

Determining what is right or wrong and establishing appropriate incentive levels to enhance functionality and unlock potential becomes a complex challenge that warrants discussion.

This is the experiment I wish to undertake.

In conclusion, our current societal framework heavily emphasizes competition, imitation, and the pursuit of material success. However, it is essential to question the efficacy of this approach and explore alternative avenues for personal and collective growth.

While competition can be a driving force, it often leads to a zero-sum game where only a few individuals emerge as winners. By shifting our focus towards collaboration, cooperation, and fostering an environment of support and safety, we can unlock the untapped potential within diverse groups of people.

By providing individuals with a margin of safety, be it through initiatives like Universal Basic Income or other innovative policies, we can empower them to pursue their passions, engage in meaningful work, and contribute to society in unique and impactful ways. This approach not only benefits individuals but also leads to the emergence of creative solutions, the optimization of existing systems, and the creation of new opportunities.

To ensure the success of such endeavors, careful evaluation and experimentation are necessary. We must strike a balance between providing incentives and fostering responsibility. Constructive punishment, designed to encourage reflection and mindfulness, can help individuals make better choices and further enhance their personal growth.

Ultimately, by challenging the status quo and actively experimenting with new approaches, we can create a society that values individual well-being, equal access to opportunities, and the pursuit of collective progress. Only through open-mindedness, critical thinking, and a commitment to inclusivity can we shape a future where everyone has the chance to thrive and make a meaningful impact.
