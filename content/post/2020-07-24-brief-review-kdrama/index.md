It's hard to strive for something and tell that something you liked to other people since a lot of them are against it. And it is much harder if you think and assume that people are against the things you liked.

And since I was boring I decided to tell what Korean Series or Movies I have watched and gratefully it is not against society. Though it is something shameful for guy because I don't know why society consider or I just assume that they are consider something scent of â€˜drama' or â€˜romance' is only intended for woman, whereas all the logical activity is included with romantism in their nerves and brain that makes them enjoying that something.

I never understand about how they make such work of art, that makes people who watch it drawn all in emotion, happiness or sadness. I regard them as the brain manipulation team that hypnotize everybody to watch it and feel about the story. Because until now I can't handle my own emotion after I watched a lot of movie, even I blame my own brain and my nerves why are they so stupid that I can't handle them even that I know it's just a fantasy about something and it should not taken seriously or maybe I haven't practiced that much to control my brain system.

Actually I have already watched a lot korean drama since I was in elementary school because I was always losed the TV battle with my sister, so I was waiting the drama until the commercial break to watched my favorite program like Naruto while I enjoyed that drama too. Those Series that I only remembered were Dream High, Coffee Prince, You're Beautiful, Flowerboy Next Door, Pasta, Kim Tak Guu, Briliant Legacy, Full house, Secret Garden, Death Bell, etc. I think there's more but I just forgot about those.

In Junior High School I thought that I didn't watched korean drama because I was busy to do other activities but in Senior High School I thought even I was busier than in JNH because I joined organizations, I'd still have times to feel the boredom and check movies on my sister's notebook. And until now if I was boring, I check on my sister's notebook to copy the movies. (I never download by myself or search further about the update of korean series, SERIOUSLY MAN I AM NOT A KOREAWEEBS). And after that, I spent my time to watched it without any burden until now.

I am sorry Ya Allah because I've wasted my times on these things and I hope that I learn something by watching a lot of these ðŸ˜€

So here's the list and brief review about korean drama that I have watched until now.

## TV Series

### Dream High

Musical drama series about dream, friendship, love, and taught me not need to care about the past bad behaviour of someone because of her beuty and in the future we know that she will be changing to be better to apologize and erase her bad behaviour in the past such hurting her friend to accomplish her dreams. There are a lot of good musics that I am used to still listening to until now too.

### Ghost (Panthom)

Well I thought that this is a horror series because the title, but after I watched 1 episode, this is not a horror. This one makes me want pursuing my career in Computer or Information worlds. No romance in here and told about the darkness of cyber world by the perspective of cyber policeman who has involved with information, misused data, corruption, jurnalism, treason, etc. Really worthed to watch

### Defendant

Series about the an attorney who killed his wife and lose his memories because strive for justice and the truth, that makes the antagonist hunt and hurt him and his family. After watching this, I want to be an attorney lol

### Signal

Thriller and drama series about random guy who received random call from history to tell about the some murder locations and activities. The story is pretty neat and well, but too much useless overacting that I didn't like

### Descendants of The Sun

Series that makes me realize the quality of Indonesian series and Korean series are pretty much different. Action, romance, comedy between Soldier and Doctor. At the start there's a lot of action scene, but comes to end it more romance that I didn't really liked.

### Fated to Loved you

Seriously man I accidentally copying and watching this. One night stand between a richman and a sad shy girl. Funny and sad at the same time, makes me cry like a baby FFFFFFFFFFFFFF

### She was pretty

Told about the story of ugly girl who unempyoyed and try to propose a job. Too much drama and her acting is excessive, but I always like about the story of life resignation and trying the best to achieve what be wanted

### Please Comeback Mister

Divinity comedy that really fun to watch about a hard workman that accidentally died and come back again to life to prove that his dying is not suicide. Stopped until episode 11 because apparently my sister only download until that episode and I didn't curious about the ending until now.

### Reply 1988

It is boring and the comedy is "receh" seriously. But the story made me retrace my childhood because even I was born in 2001, I can really connected to my past memories with friends and neighbor and family . And the Jung-Pal sad story related with me where even know they like each other, he doesn't have a brave to tell her. And thats theâ€¦. hmm FFFFFF

### Because This is my first life

About the writer who has quarter life crisis and live with an introvert working guy end up in contracted marriage. I really enjoyed this because it describe life resignation even I have to skip a lot of scene because its slow and boring. But in the end this just makes me cry like a sap lol

### Sky Castle

About the educational system be seasoned by drama and action. I think the movie whose story writer has read Nietzsche will have a great result like this series.

### School 2015

Told about a student who defend her friend that being bullied, but after that the target of bully is her on the contrary. There is a good twist in here but I am kind of boring because the plot is really slow and too dramatical

### Pinocchio

About the dark of journalism and pinocchio sindrome. Funny and Very well executed and the romance didn't too much molest the main story

### Itaewon Class

My friend is losing his faith after read the webtoon lol. The story of the son of employee in a big company and he is forced to start again his life after going to jail. Really taught about the hardwork and persistency. I didn't like the ending because I am Soo-A team. By its ending it is just showing that psychopath is always get what she wants.

### Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo

Light romcom and I should not enjoyed watching it because it is too feminine, but I actually enjoyed this. Even with skipping but still the story is quite different than others about national athlete and makes me laugh so much

### Hye Bye Mama

I completed this series from 11 pm to 2 am and it succed makes me cry like a baby and makes me blaming my brain because they're very stupid. Boring and too much drama but the story of retarded child mentality always makes me excited and curious. It's like forrest gump who ask to his wife, "Is my child like me?"

### Vagabond

I love Suzy. Action and Drama series that describe about business in Korea government that makes a ship falls by been hijacked. Maybe there is a second season. Illogical but the conspiracy about the government and corporations really interesting

### While You Were Sleeping

Boring, cringe, just stay for 1 hour

## Movies

### Scandal Makers

what i remembered is story about a radio anouncer who has a daughter when he was in high school and his daughter has a son when she was in junior high school. lots of comedy but i forgot whether the story is good or not

### Hello Ghost

i don't want to spoil. dark comedy about a moron who always fail to suicide. it made me cry

### Sunny

about high school woman friendship and the struggle of mother raise his daughter

### a werewolf boy â€‹

i have just realised that the wolf is who play in dots. very romance, didn't like it

### baby and me

maybe about a gangster who babysite an unwanted baby. forgot about the plot

### windstruck

silly, unlogic, full of drama, and has sad ending. about a policewoman who catch false thief and the love story began from there. what i liked is only the beutiful policewoman and the sad ending

### my sassy girl

light comedy and silly. the girl is evil fffffffff. succeed made me cry

### miracle in cell no.7

there's a lot of person saying that they're crying in watching this. but sadly i'm not, i don't know why. told about the disabilities father that been accused raping and murdering a child, while actually he didn't do it.

### train to busan

not really into this kind of movie but not bad since i watched it together with my friend behind damri from bandung to cimahi and it was really like a scene in romcom movie but we're just friend anyway. oh forgot, i should have written this movie summary! so it is only about zombie

### parasite

i don't know if this movie is overrated or not. very slow and boring in the beginning if you're not really into cinematography. but the story is quite original and contrast with any other movies and there is a little humour too. showing a lot of implied significances and one of the most appeling is the social discrepancy. magnificient!

### memories of murder

very slow but this is really worth watching of bong joon-ho movies and based on true story about detectives who struggle catch the murderer

### oldboy

The twist is not really legit but I like about some abstract scenes on this movie and the dialog. The message is simply powerful because it taught us to consider any little things that we are going to do and analyze what might be happened to other people
