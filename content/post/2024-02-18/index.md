Later, when you greet someone who has forgotten you, don't make her remember you.

You can pretend to be her fan while saying "take care" as you leave.

Perhaps there is suppressed trauma related to you.

Maybe remembering you will cause her to stop functioning and lose her big idea regarding a new theory or contribution to civilization.

Perhaps you're not that important to her.

Perhaps you are a disgrace/stain in her memory. And as Islam says,

لاَ يَسْتُرُ اللَّهُ عَلَى عَبْدٍ فِى الدُّنْيَا إِلاَّ سَتَرَهُ اللَّهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ

"If Allah covers the sin of a servant in the world, then Allah will also cover it on the Day of Judgment." (HR. Muslim, no. 2590)

It means that you are a sin that Allah hides in the labyrinth of her memory.

Thus her memory is made perfectly unreliable by Them.

Then it is reasonable why money politics wins, a war criminal becomes our president, a nepo baby becomes our vice president.

Supporters will justify only the good.

Haters will justify only the bad.

Philosophy is a tool to justify cowardice and laziness.

Even in the most cowardly statement and act from Bartleby and Gus Dur, we know that there are the greatest virtues in it.

Don't get trapped in nostalgia or uncertain fear, be aware of assumptions & expectations.
