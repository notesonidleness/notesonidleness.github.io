God created all beautiful scenery. What is the purpose of beauty?

And it is never enough. It is like the Alif Lam Mim and the likes Ayat.

Or it is like the 'yeee hawww' from the Jackass.

It indicates that it's not the rational that leads, but the irrational, the redundant, the ineffective.

That is the fallacy where they see others similar to them, so they feel like they are replaceable, unimportant, and useless.

All the mountains, seas, you name it, all are never enough. The Big Other tries to make something more efficient by words, by transferring the words to the Illiterate.

And that's the paradox of omnipotence. Even though all beauty seems pointless and can't be understood, it feels that it is beauty.

It crucifies itself by transferring knowledge, to make it more efficient. Words are the most efficient things, because humans are designed to grasp only words, 1 or 0, easier. They are never capable of acknowledging the existence of a state that contains both 1 and 0.

And it resembles all pictures, videos, music, or games as the combination of all, inefficient, and cannot be rationalized. That something can't be talked about is the precursor of everything. Whether in the Big Five, they show the statistics of people who are perceived as successful having rationality and consciousness, openness. But the truly impactful ones are the ones who act crazy and are full of madness and obsessions.

And if you can't find laughter in any words you find, then there's something wrong with you. It's not the sounds of the 'moo' from a cow that emit the CH4 into the atmosphere. It is not the fault of the words, it's just that I'm incapable of seeing what is beauty because all I hear is laughter. I'm blinded not by the light, but I'm deafened by the laughter. And you can't see that I'm deaf because all you see is darkness. But my clarification, by providing something efficient like words, is futile. I simply want to tell you that it is not the darkness that I see; I see a little of Kaf Ha Ya Ain Sin Qof and I see all beauty through it.

And just because I can laugh at the things I see, just because I can dance, just because I can sing, it doesn't mean I'm devaluing those who are blind, or those who are tone-deaf, or those who can't move their waists.

It simply shows the illusion (story) that always becomes the substance, not the facts. Because facts dissolve in the ocean of story. That makes chaotic Mother Nature the leader of everything. That really explains why women are much inclined and keen on fiction, because truth is a woman, because fiction is the substance, the sea, the galaxy, all things resembling virulence.
