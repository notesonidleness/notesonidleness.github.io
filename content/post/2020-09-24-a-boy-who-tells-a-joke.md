title: A Boy Who Tells A Joke
---
A teacher taught what he can do to his students. At started he was cheerful, humorist, and interesting. But he doesn't know why sometimes he loses all of it.

And the day like before never happened again tomorrow

He taught with all his heart, even though he knew that his students were not interested and bored with the topic. In the end, the students did not pay attention and talking with their friends.

In the beginning, the teacher didn't mind it, someone must have paid attention, one student at least, he thought. But after a long time he explained, he began to feel that no one was paying attention to him. All ignore it.

And there is 1 student who is annoyed with his friend and feels sorry for his teacher. He saw the teacher explaining with all his heart, until his words began to get messy. He looked at his teacher's face, changed from exciting to slightly angry. However, he thought that his teacher's face did not show anger, but that he showed sadness, that is, sorrow for neglect.

His explanation started to get messy, until he stopped his explanation on the blackboard, turned to his student and placed his palms on the table. He sighed, looked at his student with a hateful look, and suddenly left the classroom.

One of the students' friends asked each other, what's happening and why the teacher was like that. But the student was silent and felt he really understood what the teacher was feeling.

Untill his emotion really burst, thinking why his friends can't respect his teacher. He became angry, crying, stand up, and shout,

"The one who doesn't cry has no heart!"

He didn't know what he was saying and what come through his mouth is only those words. His friends confused at him for a while and later everyone in those class gone silent and confuse …

That student grows and is no longer a child 9 years old. Then he knew that what was happened before is not any others fault, not him, his friends, or his teacher.

He knew too about what called Respect, that everyone has their way to express respect. In the teacher's case, his friends were not wrong because they showed respect which the teacher responded it as wrong, the teacher was not wrong because he had more respect for himself, and that student himself didn't feel wrong at that time because yelling at his friends was also respectful.

He also mistook his teacher's expression. What he realized was that sadness or happiness could not be seen from one's expression. Many people said those who are happy is always smile, or it can be looked at their eyes, but everyone is wrong. Because happiness can only be measured by shit. The less the shit he is, the happier he is. Even the one who never eats is the happiest, because he always feels enough, is not excessive, and is unable to process organic matter.

It's only there's something more dominant than others in term of respect. And by showing respect in the second place doesn't mean that they didn't have a respect.

What most important things he learned is "Do not allow yourself to be blinded by fear or anger, everything is only as it is…". Everyone loves a joke and it leads to everything is a joke. Everything is perfect that he thought he didn't really need to do something because everything is a joke, and every joke is perfect, and it leads to everything is a joke or every joke is everything, and everything is perfect and visa versa

And in the end he conclude that…  
IGNORANT IS BLISS
