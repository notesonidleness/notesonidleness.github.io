title: The Law of Comedy ~ Part 2

My biases always search for the law of comedy which is universal. And it is never constructed against the law of comedy. Left wing or right wing, poor or rich, conservative or liberal, socialism or communism, everything looks different because of the word "or". If every "or" of them combine with "and" then everything actually has no different from them, any of them always leads to something the same, which is the output of law comedy.

That's why even though we consumed everything, we never felt satisfied. We didn't experience being slaved literally, tortured or forced to do something physically, or being in a great war, or any other events in the past that looked so horrible. We can do everything now or have the sense of living that makes us far from the law of comedy, and it always leads to dissatisfaction, having the sense of living.

We're kind of longing and want to be in the life of animals, the life of cats, which is ignorant, lazy, didn't need to pursue their dreams to become a professor or president, but seems so calm and satisfied. It is because the law of comedy has not been followed, and the law of comedy has not been followed if someone takes away his logic and forgets about this law.

The problem with manipulating gender or fulfilling the desire to live couldn't be looked at as a right, but it needed to be looked at from the perspective of universal rule, the law of comedy.

It is not they are wrong to do such things with the perspective of living and humanity, but the law of comedy didn't care about humanity and living, and it didn't change the fact that their manipulation is just manipulation and their chromosome even still as it is, not change based on their believed that they have been changed. They said everything is subjective and it really started from here. Subjectivity means the sense of living, and it is always against the law of comedy.

And let's talk about social media. Every story of highlighted social media supports all subjectivity and that what makes the sense of living, and it leads to never having satisfaction. Hoax and political news, every makeup and filter, each of that makes us lose trust in the system and that always leads us far from the law of comedy and objectivity. It created subjectivity and hyperrealism where we struggle to distinguish between real or not.

And it occurred to those who want to be beautiful. Everyone aims to be beautiful and do everything to achieve that, like nothing is good more than beauty. And when beautiness becomes popular, there's always those who say that beauty does not matter, and ugliness becomes popular, and the cycle continues to occur. And the cycle of that, is part of the rule of comedy, that everything is a joke like this video 

Once we lose trust and have doubts, it always leads to more doubts. By having a lot of doubts, we make ourselves mistrust everything and far from the law of comedy. It started from little things like news, the internet, or books. It makes everyone questioning,

"What is real?",

"What is good?",

everything looks so fake and subjective and that what makes everyone living ignorantly, fakefully, and keep questioning and fall to the conclusion,

When we want to fight something and don't tolerate the foolish, we might ask ourselves,

"Am I really right?"

Then because we're full of doubt, we make assumptions that everything is right, nothing is wrong. And in the end we're doing nothing to fight the fools.
