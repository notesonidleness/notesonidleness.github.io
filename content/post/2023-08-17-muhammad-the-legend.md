title: Musings on Life, Legends, and the Quirks of Human Nature

You know what Pareto once said, right? It's like he figured out that only 20 percent of folks are doing 80 percent of the cool stuff. The rest of us are stuck with these mind-numbing jobs that could easily be replaced by robots.

Now, speaking of Indonesia, it's a Muslim-majority place, but that whole "Isy kariman Au Mutsyahidan", live gloriously or die a martyr thing? Well, it's more of a catchy slogan than anything else.

I've got this wild idea, though. If Muhammad were around today, I bet he'd be all into data-driven stuff like tech surveillance, kinda like China's social credit system or Sam's effective altruism, or maybe even Sabrang Leto's symbolic actions. He'd be all about making things transparent, rewarding the good guys, and smacking down the corrupt ones. You know what's cool? Muhammad was like the OG successful businessman, even though he started out as an orphan. Total legend, man.

But here's the twist: what's heaven for one person can be pure hell for someone else. If they actually pulled off these utopian e-accountability projects based on similar ideologies, I'd probably be the first one in the hot seat. I mean, who's got time for all this progress nonsense when you're just too lazy to get on board?

You see, data can't capture those deep-down feels, man. Art? That's the stuff that goes beyond numbers and stats. It's born out of that empty, bored feeling, you know? Creatio ex nihilo, baby. From nothing, something.

And here's the kicker: why is it that when you want more, people call you greedy and arrogant, but when you're grateful for what you've got, they still give you a hard time? Life's funny that way, ain't it?
