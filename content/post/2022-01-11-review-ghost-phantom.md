Introduction:
"Ghost/Phantom" is a Korean drama series that delves into the world of cybercrime and journalism, shedding light on the inherent corruption within society. Through its portrayal of media sensationalism and the cyclical nature of complaints and profits, the show provides a thought-provoking analysis of our collective flaws. This essay will explore these themes and their implications in contemporary society.

1. The Portrayal of Corruption:
"Ghost/Phantom" exposes the deep-seated corruption that permeates society. The series highlights how individuals, driven by personal gain and power, manipulate and exploit others. It unveils a darker side of humanity, showcasing the lengths to which people will go to fulfill their self-interests. This portrayal serves as a stark reminder of the inherent flaws and moral decay that can exist within society.

2. Media Sensationalism and Exaggerated News:
The show astutely critiques the media's tendency to engage in sensationalism and propagate exaggerated news. It draws attention to the dangerous influence of social media platforms, where individuals, acting as self-proclaimed social justice warriors, often react impulsively without verifying facts. This phenomenon enables the spread of misinformation and clickbait, driven solely by profit-seeking media corporations.

3. Temporary Satisfaction in Complaining:
"Ghost/Phantom" highlights the irony of our tendency to complain about various issues. It suggests that many individuals find temporary satisfaction in voicing their grievances, often without taking concrete action to address the underlying problems. This fleeting sense of superiority can lead to complacency, as the same individuals may easily forget the issues they once vehemently protested against.

4. The Exploitative Cycle:
The drama portrays a vicious cycle that perpetuates itself within the media industry. News corporations are well aware of the transitory nature of public outrage, capitalizing on readers' emotions by spreading clickbait and exaggerated news stories. These tactics attract higher engagement and drive profits, creating a self-reinforcing loop. Ironically, investors willingly support these media companies, contributing to the perpetuation of sensationalism despite their own complaints about the state of news.

5. The Role of Investors:
"Ghost/Phantom" sheds light on the ironic role of investors who fund advertising companies engaged in disseminating exaggerated and meaningless news. These investors pride themselves on their profits, all while voicing their dissatisfaction with the very news they financially support. The drama highlights the dissonance between their complaints and actions, illustrating the complexities of their involvement in the media industry.

Conclusion:
"Ghost/Phantom" provides a compelling and thought-provoking commentary on the corruption ingrained within society, media sensationalism, and the vicious cycle of complaints and profits. The drama exposes the flaws in our collective behavior, emphasizing how easily we succumb to reactionary tendencies without addressing the underlying issues. It highlights the irony of individuals who both complain about exaggerated news and financially support the very entities perpetuating it. Ultimately, the show serves as a cautionary tale, urging viewers to reflect on their own complicity in perpetuating corrupt systems and encouraging a more discerning and proactive approach to media consumption and societal issues.
