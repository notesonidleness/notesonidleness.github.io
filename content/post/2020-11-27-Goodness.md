title: Goodness

```text
I knew nothing about good
I ask everyone
They knew sometimes
But it contradicted each other's

They say good is amenity,
Good is luxury,
Good is beauty,
Good is sufficiency,
Good is empathy,
Good is lunacy.

I am searching for good
Then I classified these people
When I should not do

The thinker or the feeler,
The wise or who ignore
The holy and the infidel

I ask good to whom love to be wise
Their answers making sick my brain

The holy told me not to use the brain
But use the heart to feel the good

The thinker showed me
Heart makes people weak
And the weak never find any good

Another said to use both of them
Brain and the heart

But I can't understand it
It contradicted each other

It made my brain sick
And it made my heart weak

And now I am asking you father,
What is good?

Why should I be good?
Why should I be good when you aren't?
How can I be to stray further from you?
Is it because I just want to be...
Good?
