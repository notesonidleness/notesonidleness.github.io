title: Silicon Valley Series Review
---

The worst comedy series I've ever watched.

Irrelevant for me but still can be related to my perspective of my life. The geeks, the nerds, with asperger syndrome whose name is Richard. But yup like any other characters, it's not fair if it's only filled with misfortune, so the director or the writer add the advantages to his character which include he is the best programmer in his circle.

I don't want to describe all, you could read it somewhere about the synopsis. Just don't watch it so that only me who killing my time with this unfaedah (unbeneficial) thing and maybe you could imagine the story of the series by my writing.

So my friends from my faculty (computer science) once said that our faculty is creepy.

> "Just look at the personality type of these students, most of them are introvert and analytical. You know that in this world those kinds of types are rare. And here, they are just gathered in this faculty." 

My friends claimed that he was an INTP, even though I never get why so many people believe that they have such a constant characteristic of their soul or something like that, so I send him this video to at least make him skeptical about what has been taught in the society or curriculum of the university.

So comeback again to Silicon Valley, the portrait of many scenes in Silicon Valley is quite accurate.

Like the connotation which is attached to IT person, or IT groups, 4 eyes, skinny, weird, unattractive, etc. Even many of the students not as what has been objective in majority of people, but well, I am just like that haha 

This scene is really funny for me.

No matter how angry the IT kids are, when they are got angry, it always turns out to be funny. 

And this Bighead.

Very retarded yet got a lot of miracle and luck. At first season I cried seeing his condition that he is very mediocre at Jared s team. I kind of related to him lol and it suddenly the director made a really funny plot to him and I just don't know, I think I really feel regret after I pity him, because at the next season he is given something which he really passionated about, which is doing nothing, and his passion is same as me.

And there is this villain in some season, Gavin Belson, a CEO of big venture capital company which really represents the worst capitalist in the world, who don't care about breaking his own enemy as long as he could be the winner.

> "I don't want other company make this world is a better place than we do. Only us that can make the world become a better place."


And this scene making me laugh so hard.

At first I think it is just a comedy and fictional, but this scene is actually came from a real event in this world lol.



The characters in this series are just perfect. And everyone is really funny. This series is really genius I think I don't know. Even though there still some cringe scenes, but overall, this really entertain me at this pandemic. I hope that the director responsible to me in the afterlife because he wasting my time to watch his series and wasted my energy to laugh so hard in this series
