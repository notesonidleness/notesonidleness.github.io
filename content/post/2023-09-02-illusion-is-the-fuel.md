title: Illusion is The Fuel

Illusion is the fuel of acceleration and substance 

To appreciate someone, with insignificant achievement, something little. 

Someone doesn't care about appreciation if what they want is to only survive.

How can someone appreciate themself more deeper, more meaningful? It's tricky, because someone might feel small with no appreciation. Sometimes the trophy is mispresents to someone. One always need to take the patent. 

To take a patent is to responsible for their risk. But those who lead, what makes them entitled to take the patent with no risk, only glorified the achievement but not the defect. 

Why must we glorify a little things, called gratitude. Something great doesn't need to be grateful about. Only the insignificant concern about what people appreciate them.
