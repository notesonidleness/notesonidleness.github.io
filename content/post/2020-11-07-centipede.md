title: Centipede
---
Slept with centipedes in the dark was the most awesome thing which I've been experienced.

I feel like something is crawling on my neck. I thought it was just an ant, but what kind of ant crawling like a worm and my hypothesis it was a worm, and I really got scared of it.

I might not scared If I knew the effect of worm crawling on my skin but I always afraid of what I don't know and at that time I knew nothing about a worm so I was paranoid about that.

I tried to pick it up horridly.

And suddenly I tried to see it in the dark and it had a spark on my hand. It spread through my hand, a green special light of centipede.

When I realize that it was a centipede, I became more terrified.

I didn't know but there's a whisper in my ears.

"Don't be afraid, just look at it. Don't panic. Everything is only as it is."

And suddenly I stare at it calmly.

The beautiful light in the dark which I always assume it gives me pain.

But actually, it's not.

It just blazes through my hand and it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

And I began to feel dismal because I realized that gave me that beautiful scene is its dying.

I kill him and that what makes a beautiful scene.
