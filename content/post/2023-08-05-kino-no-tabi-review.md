title: Kino no Tabi, Job Hopping and The Modern Nomad
---

Job hopping resembles the traveler's journey in Kino's travels in "Kino no Tabi." Traveling seems to be a dream shared by many, akin to creating a legacy like Ibn Battuta and others did in previous generations. However, this notion appears outdated now due to the advent of tools like Google Maps. While such tools cover most places, some areas remain uncharted, and they fail to capture the true ambiance and local behavior, or in a places like China might lack comprehensive map reviews due to strict government policies.

I recall Mark Manson's stories that suggest reaching a stage where being a traveler is perceived as aimless, a way to escape from dealing with issues or challenges. Such travelers wander around cities and renowned tourist spots, as advertised by agencies, without any specific goal.

Although I view being a digital nomad positively, I've come to realize that it's a form of risk diversification rather than full commitment to one's beliefs. This is influenced by the fear of catastrophic outcomes that befall loyal and committed individuals. Their blind spots or unexpected events encourage us to avoid complete commitment and instead become versatile in various fields.

The analogy of job hopping aligns with this concept. We are often driven by Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, necessitating a safety buffer before embarking on significant endeavors. The challenge is determining the exact amount required for this buffer. Consequently, people end up collecting insignificant gains without a clear objective, lacking critical self-evaluation.

This scenario mirrors Kino's experiences. Job hoppers move from one company to another, feeling lost and detached. They constantly seek fulfillment and believe that specific places, companies, or people will make them complete. However, these notions are often illusions, an 'Arrival Fallacy' of reaching a certain point of contentment. This behavior resembles the cosmopolitan attitude, as they flit between jobs, honing their nonchalant approach and minimal engagement.

Some larger companies maintain robust procedures and management systems, subscribing to high-end tools like Jira or Workday. They emphasize work-life balance and are financially stable. Despite this, some individuals like Kino remain discontented, feeling that their role is dispensable and doesn't contribute to society.

These individuals jump from one company to another, exploring varying cultures. While some lack formal knowledge management and documented procedures, they foster a familial atmosphere that provides security. However, conservatism often stifles constructive feedback, particularly from younger members.

Kino desires to experience different company cultures, each with distinct traits. This exploration leads to a realization: not belonging means potential acceptance by everyone, yet also implies rejection by all. This notion gradually dawns, even if the initial idea was to indulge in aimless touring. Such thoughts are social constructs, perpetuated by contagious ideas.

Kino doesn't recognize that she suppresses her desire to travel beyond the realm of companies due to resource limitations. She rationalizes her choice and denounces those who can freely enjoy nonsensical sceneries.

Ultimately, job hopping reflects the new form of nomadism. Not all wanderers are adrift; their purpose may shift over time. Nomads can be perceived as purposeful explorers at one point and aimless individuals evading reality or acting against national interests in another context. This fluid perception stems from societal constructs and varying perspectives.
