<p>It's hard to strive for something and tell that something you liked to other people since a lot of them are against it. And it is much harder if you think and assume that people are against the things you liked.</p>

<p>And since I was boring I decided to tell what Korean Series or Movies I have watched and gratefully it is not against society. Though it is something shameful for guy because I don't know why society consider or I just assume that they are consider something scent of â€˜drama' or â€˜romance' is only intended for woman, whereas all the logical activity is included with romantism in their nerves and brain that makes them enjoying that something.â€‹</p>

<p>I never understand about how they make such work of art, that makes people who watch it drawn all in emotion, happiness or sadness. I regard them as the brain manipulation team that hypnotize everybody to watch it and feel about the story. Because until now I can't handle my own emotion after I watched a lot of movie, even I blame my own brain and my nerves why are they so stupid that I can't handle them even that I know it's just a fantasy about something and it should not taken seriously or maybe I haven't practiced that much to control my brain system.</p>

<p>Actually I have already watched a lot korean drama since I was in elementary school because I was always losed the TV battle with my sister, so I was waiting the drama until the commercial break to watched my favorite program like Naruto while I enjoyed that drama too. Those Series that I only remembered were Dream High, Go joon Pyo, pasta, bread, brian legacy, full house, death bell. I think there's more but I just forgot about those.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In Junior High School I thought that I didn't watched korean drama because I was busy to do other activities but in Senior High School I thought even I was busier than in JNH because I joined organizations, I'd still have times to feel the boredom and check movies on my sister's notebook. And until now if I was boring, I check on my sister's notebook to copy the movies. (I never download by myself or search further about the update of korean series, SERIOUSLY MAN I AM NOT A KOREAWEEBS). And after that, I spent my time to watched it without any burden until now.</p>

<p>I am sorry Ya Allah because I've wasted my times on these things and I hope that I learn something by watching a lot of these ðŸ˜€</p>

<p>not really into this kind of movie but not bad since i watched it together with my friend behind damri from bandung to cimahi and it was really like a scene in romcom movie but we're just friend anyway. oh forgot, i should have written this movie summary! so it is only about zombie</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>i don't know if this movie is overrated or not. very slow and boring in the beginning if you're not really into cinematography. but the story is quite original and contrast with any other movies and there is a little humour too. showing a lot of implied significances and one of the most appeling is the social discrepancy. magnificient!</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>very slow but this is really worth watching of bong joon-ho movies and based on true story about detectives who struggle catch the murderer</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The twist is not really legit but I like about some abstract scenes on this movie and the dialog. The message is simply powerful because it taught us to consider any little things that we are going to do and analyze what might be happened to other people</p>
