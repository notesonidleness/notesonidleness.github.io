LinkedIn, the professional networking platform, provides a glimpse into the world of marketing and self-promotion. As we navigate through various profiles, we often encounter a mix of genuine accomplishments and exaggerated self-portrayals. This experience raises intriguing questions about the nature of marketing, the network effect, and the parallels with the critically acclaimed film "Parasite." In this essay, we will explore the lessons derived from observing LinkedIn profiles and draw connections to the network effect depicted in "Parasite."

Marketing and the Self:

Upon examining LinkedIn profiles, it becomes evident that marketing is a fundamentally human endeavor. People use marketing techniques to showcase their skills, experiences, and accomplishments. However, personal discomfort arises when we realize that the products being sold are ourselves. We tend to hesitate when acknowledging that we are capable of exaggerating or even lying to promote our personal brand. This realization highlights the complex relationship between authenticity and self-promotion.

Exaggeration and Comparison:

One aspect that stands out in LinkedIn profiles is the tendency to exaggerate accomplishments. Upon scrutinizing a friend's profile, we often recognize that many achievements are embellished, providing a distorted representation of their true abilities. Interestingly, while we do not generally complain about exaggerated advertisements on television, we find it disconcerting when we witness the same behavior in ourselves. This discrepancy stems from the discomfort of acknowledging that we, too, are capable of deception.

Network Effect and Rules:

LinkedIn operates within the realm of the network effect, whereby the value of the platform is dependent on the number and influence of its users. Similarly, in "Parasite," the characters' livelihoods are intertwined through a network that shapes their survival. In both cases, following the rules and norms of the network becomes crucial. Deviating from the established conventions can make it exceedingly difficult to thrive and succeed. This illustrates how the network effect can exert control over individuals and their actions.

Word of Mouth and Comparison:

LinkedIn relies heavily on word of mouth to validate one's skills and expertise. Recommendations from others within the network serve as a proving mechanism. While this system can provide inspiration and motivation, it also leads to unhealthy comparisons. Individuals find themselves constantly measuring their achievements against those of others, potentially leading to feelings of inadequacy or self-doubt. This aspect of LinkedIn resonates with "Parasite," where the characters constantly compare their lives and social standing, often to their detriment.

The "Parasite" Connection:

Bong Joon-ho's film "Parasite" presents a masterful exploration of societal disparities and the network effect. The characters' struggles to survive and climb the social ladder mirror the challenges faced by individuals navigating LinkedIn. The film emphasizes the damaging consequences of an imbalanced network, where those who cannot adhere to its rules are relegated to the fringes of society. Both "Parasite" and LinkedIn shed light on the power dynamics inherent in networks and the detrimental effects they can have on individuals.

Examining LinkedIn profiles provides valuable insights into the intricacies of marketing and self-promotion. It reminds us that the products we sell are ourselves, raising questions about authenticity and deception. Moreover, LinkedIn's network effect reinforces the importance of following established rules and norms for success. However, it also cultivates a tendency for unhealthy comparisons and self-doubt. The film "Parasite" echoes these themes by exploring the consequences of the network effect in a broader social context. By critically analyzing these parallels, we gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics that shape our personal and professional lives.
