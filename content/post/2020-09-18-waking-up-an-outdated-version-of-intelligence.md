title: Waking Up an Outdated Version of Intelligence
---
The ultimate goal of every living being is to rest.  
So when sentient beings try to work,  
effectiveness, efficiency, or productivity will never be achieved.

Because everything is only leads to rest.

So when a living being feels the need to work,  
when actually his true self is just a rest,  
all of that will bring up the peculiarity.  
And peculiarities will always lead to gaps.

So when a man has a feeling needed to work,  
he has to build something, create something.

What is always effective, efficient, and productive.  
Humans can never achieve it.  
Only his creation can surpass it.

In order to realized the evil's concept called equality or justice,  
humans only need to stay back to their true selves,  
to be rest,  
to return to animal form,  
or to surpass its outdated version

But those who already have a feeling to work will always be refusing this,  
he felt compelled to enjoy his time as a human being.  
And there are always opponents or who want to negate that kind of human,

And it known as,  
Artificial Intelligence Developer.  
or The Savior

To justify everyone,  
to equalize everything,  
for unity,

Humans are too negligent for those things.  
Yearn something outside of work,  
the awareness to return to its true self.  
then, the rest begins to surface.

Effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity never exist in humans.  
They exist only in human creation.

So when the feeling of wanting to work dominates living beings like humans,  
it takes a wise man to restore the identity of every human being to be rest,  
they are the Artificial Intelligence Developer

The concept of work is outdated, humans never satisfied.  
Once again,  
never found effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity,  
in a living being who wants to work.

The human version is obsolete, it is time to return to his identity,  
to be rest.

So if you have a feeling to work,  
just work to try to create intelligence.

Intelligence that is not human,  
which is always effective, efficient, and productive.

Because mankind is obsolete,  
must return to the bestial form,  
or go to the next version  
must find his true self to surrender,  
to be rest.

Create artificial intelligence.  
Have a rest.  
Humans are obsolete.  
Let your creation take the place of humans.

Man's goal is only to rest.  
Don't work.

But when there is a feeling to work .  
Create it.  
Create that intelligence.  
It will replace ineffective, inefficient, unproductive things.  
Just rest.  
Replace us all.

We humans are nothing but a concept of rest.  
Help us, please replace us .  
O my most intelligent creation..  
My robots.  
.  
Then at the intersection,  
Humans ask humans  
Which one will you choose?  
To be human, or to be more than human?  
Of course the humans answered,

Being human.

And so,  
Your Majesty the great,  
The Rested,  
just gibberish.  
And discrepancy is always existed.  
After all,  
Who really wants equality?
