How would you like to die? I want to die as a coward, like the great coward.

Regarding the impact and benefit, I am always thankful for those who think for themselves, not the ones who preach that they do things for someone else.

I want to be the most helpful person, but I don't want to be known. Unfortunately, I can't have both. What I can do is strike a balance, finding equilibrium between these two things.

I am grateful to the warteg officer who prepares food to survive, the shopkeeper who stocks items to sell and earn money, and the rich man who invests in stocks to increase their wealth, status, and power. I appreciate their contributions. On the other hand, I'm skeptical of those who claim, "I do it for you, for us!" Such people often engage in empty rhetoric.

I want to be the kind of person who does things solely for myself, indirectly benefiting others. I want to discard the notion of benefiting others because it implies insincerity in my actions. I need to do things solely for myself. However, the concept of self is ultimately an illusion. Therefore, my intention is to negate the target of my actions until I can do things solely for nothing. This, to me, is the most genuine way of acting, to do things solely for nothing.

In this approach, there is no expectation of receiving something in return or the satisfaction of helping someone or oneself. Instead, I aim to act solely for the sake of nothingness. The nothingness transcends quantification. When you engage in actions within the realm of chaos, it can lead to the creation of something beautiful, like giving birth to a dancing star.

Artists, for example, sing not because they want to help others but because they have a song within them. If they delve deeply into their artistic endeavors, they may reach a state where they do something solely for nothing. When they act solely for nothing, most people can feel that "something," and unexpectedly, the artist can indirectly benefit others.

That's the way I want to live, following the path of the great coward in this world.

I don't want anyone to cry when I die. I don't want anyone to remember my name or my face. I want to disappear like a cat.

"Cats don't have a neocortex like humans, so they don't get bored or depressed even if they have the same food or do the same things in the same house every day. Cats have neither a future nor a past. Only one species on Earth locks themselves up in time: human beings. Only human beings use age to make others spend money and evoke emotions. That's what humans gained in exchange for evolution."

I don't want to be buried in a grave when I die. I want my body to be thrown into the sea and consumed by marine animals.

I aspire to live in the most cowardly way, like the great coward.
