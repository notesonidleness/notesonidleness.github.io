title: "Sakamoto Unmasked: Navigating Tyranny with Elegance"

Man is mortal; thus, every man is replaceable.

Dependency is something I never force onto someone or any system. If I am somehow needed by someone, I try to help, but not to make them dependent on me. I want everything to be loosely coupled. I want to give every beautiful thing I have and then perish.

For a company, organization, or family, I don't want to be seen as irreplaceable. Another must replace me, another must replace me, even if it means letting go of me, to ensure everything remains loosely coupled.

I want everything to be light, so there's always room to grow for anyone. A system can't thrive if it's burdened by manipulation and exaggeration.

I won't create dirty, unreadable code so the company becomes dependent on me. I won't monopolize communication; I must be transparent, showing everything I have in a proper way.

I won't make my work appear more difficult and time-consuming just to confuse the manager, allowing me to do as I please with my free time. If my price is reasonable, I won't make it seem exorbitant by embellishing and using unnecessary words on my CV.

The cost of manipulation is so high; it turns illusion into the substance of everything, leveraging something perishable. That is the act of clowns, actors, and jesters.

I don't aspire to be the main actor. I do the best I can in a proper way. Even when people exploit and abuse me, I simply feel grateful for what they do.

It's so common for people to engage in such behavior. 'Be kind,' they say.

In Islam, the best jihad is to fight tyrannical figures.

But I rarely find this in most Muslims. Instead, they do just as I do: engage in something that feels good, and then others exploit their work, and they act as if they're okay with it. They never take the bait of the abuser.

And you find your justification, 'just be grateful,' 'Gusti Allah mboten sare,' 'karma is real,' and so on.

You allow all the abusers to be comfortable with their actions. I act as if I were blind, not to see all the tyrannical things, and hope that nature could seek revenge for us.

But that's not the Sakamoto way. Sakamoto rationalizes and sharpens his intuition; he is neither the nice kid nor the good guy. He is aware of what others are capable of, so he acts in a beautiful way, without complaint or fostering hatred. He simply wants to disillusion all the tyrants to behave as beautifully as he does, to ignore and surpass anyone's expectations.

In doing so, he both helps and challenges the tyrants, making them realize that they are tyrants. There is real action there, no matter how pseudo your definition of 'real.'

While most people don't reach that level, instead, they let the abusers continue without remorse for what they do, allowing them to fall into a state of delusion. They try to find cheap pleasure to suppress their malicious hearts. One must rise above Sakamoto.
