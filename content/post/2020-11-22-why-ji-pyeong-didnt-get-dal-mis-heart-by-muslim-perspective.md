The reasons why Ji Pyeong didn't get Dal Mi's heart even though he is rich:  
  
- He didn't get the wealth in a halal way.

He invests in haram companies.  
Since he was an orphan, he learned to invest because he wants to be rich as fast as he can so he didn't care about the sources of the money. He studied economy and finance but didn't learn about sharia principles. He ended up investing in prohibited businesses, such as conventional banking companies, as well as companies that produce or trade haram and un-"tayyib" goods (for example cigarette and liquor factories). The company that gave him a lot of profit is the Soju producer because Soju is selling well in South Korea.

- He is not only did investing but also speculating

Investment is not prohibited, but speculating is yes. Trading which has speculative characteristics is prohibited because it is like gambling. Speculating could bring someone to gain wealth fastly, but at the same time, it doesn't give certainty to the company or the economy. But he didn't care about his activities so in his leisure at the early stage, he did trading a lot. Because of that, he can fund his study by himself at the university even if he is an orphan. But of course it is not a good way, because actually he can look for the fund for study by scholarship and others, and not depend on trading.  
  
- He always doubts and full of suudzon

He suudzon-ed Dal Mi's grandmother about the money, he supposed she stole his money because he is full of doubt and prejudice. And not only that, when he became an angel investor after he was rich enough, he actually didn't care about what's happening in the startup or company he invested in. What he cares about is only about the profit. So he is always manipulative and treats a lot of entrepreneurs who want to start a business badly because what he wants is only profit. He ended up hurting others, moreover there was an entrepreneur who commited suicide because Ji Pyeong hurt him by telling the truth that his business is trash and will not sell well.  
  




Actually he could get Dal Mi's heart or get someone better if he does "Taubatan Nasuha". But if he still mainted his bad business and ungood manner, he might not get Dal Mi's heart because his prayer is rejected. If he still gets Dal Mi's heart, it means that he is in the â€˜Istidraj' stage.  
  
Friendship or love relationship is like the funding development of startup. Pre seed, seed, A-Series, B-Series, C-Series, and IPO.  
  
But many relationships only last in pre seed and seed stage. It dies before going to the next level. Because the foundation of a lot of relationships is fragile, susceptible, and like scum. It is like the value of bulging startup
