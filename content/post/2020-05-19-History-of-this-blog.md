It's Eid Al-Fitr, 5 days ago 19 years, it's gone crazy because of the pandemic. Lots of assignments, 2 weeks off and I'm still lazy but lazy to study even though 23 credits and many materials have been forgotten

Finally I'm wasting my time playing ML, PUBG, hacking cellphones, installing custom roms, theming substratum, flowdor, reading crime and punishment but bored, after Ramadhan worship suddenly lazy, watching Bungou Stray Dogs is over and lazy to watch others, watching youtube harvest moon, bathing cows, mukbang, tedtalk, philosophy, rumaysho, sadhguru, psycothis. very very bored.

I'm still in the confused phase what to do, until I see old Facebook statuses,

although there is a status like the one above that really relates to now but still,

**how come life used to be more colorful huh?**

You already know that stress is caused by wasting time and isn't productive, but if you want to be productive you're also lazy, until you're really tired of what to do. Lying down, overthinking, it's stupid to study stupid and mentally too. Finally fell asleep...



إِذْ يُغَشِّيكُمُ ٱلنُّعَاسَ أَمَنَةً مِّنْهُ وَيُنَزِّلُ عَلَيْكُم مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ مَآءً لِّيُطَهِّرَكُم بِهِۦ وَيُذْهِبَ عَنكُمْ رِجْزَ ٱلشَّيْطَٰنِ وَلِيَرْبِطَ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتَ بِهِ ٱلْأَقْدَامَ



"(Remember), when Allah made you sleepy as a comfort from Him, and Allah sent down rain from the sky for you to purify you with it and remove from you the troubles of the devil and to strengthen your heart and strengthen your palms." QS. Al-Anfal verse 11.



I fell asleep washing my face, praying duha with extra speed. I don't know if the prayer is accepted or not, the important thing is to pray and be sure, 1 minute, done, and immediately I turn on the laptop, thank God there is no wifi password. Gathering the intention to do discrete math homework and statistics, just opened the question, I already thought about it,

"What is this material for?"

"What if what you learn is in vain"

"What if you don't use it in the future work?"

"How do you make your parents proud..."

and other foolishness of mind



Finally browsing about the information systems department because I felt that I was in the wrong major after hearing the reviews, and continued to face the PSSI matkul (information systems principle), which made me very confuse about studying, even though I was in semester 2 :P

And meet [blog ](http://annisaaurelia.wordpress.com/) review majoring in SI. And after reading a few posts...

weird.

suddenly the energy is full again, I don't know why, I suddenly remember the good times I used to read [blog](https://www.gilang-ramadhan.id) itb child from sman 4 bandung that made me really want to go to stei itb but it didn't work keep on reviewing blogs for kating fasilkom, scholarship blogs, and I don't know why reading a few words fills up the energy very well! (very good).

It's really strange, the mind, subconscious, etc., they can't be predicted. Little things can make a big difference. Even though I've watched psychology videos to be mentally strong, it's still, there's a little thing that make your spirits up and down, from worse to better. But I don't know if I'm really hyper sensitive and stupid in terms of EQ haha.

And when I read that, thank God I was able to gather more enthusiasm to study for UAS. and from reading that blog this afternoon, I finally wanted to tell you about life experiences and unboxing life reviews

Hopefully people who are tired, suddenly discouraged can be like me at this hour after reading my writing, their energy is filled again,

So if you've made people get motivated again, what's next?

Does life have a purpose?

I don't care, just question your religion and philosophizing alone, I just want to remind you to keep fighting, don't get discouraged

And this blog is nothing but a waste of time during the pandemic.

And I hope this blog will be a blessing.

Amen
