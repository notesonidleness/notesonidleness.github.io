title: 'The Illusion of Money: Exploring Ideology, Social Proof, and Economic Disparities'
---

Title: 

Introduction:
After watching the thought-provoking film "Schindler's List," I found myself contemplating the connection between the illusion of money and its inability to trade ideology. Money, while a powerful tool, may not be enough to save those influenced by strong and destructive ideologies. In this article, we will delve into the complexities of money, its impact on society, the importance of vision and charisma, the destructive nature of social proof, the consequences of economic disparities, and the power dynamics that shape our world.

The Limitations of Money and Ideology:
Money, as a means of exchange and accumulation, can yield significant influence. However, it fails to override deeply entrenched ideological beliefs. While one can make an effort to save individuals affected by harmful ideologies, it often becomes clear that money alone is never enough. Powerful ideologies are fueled by visions, charisma, and respect, making them impervious to monetary solutions. This realization highlights the need to address ideological issues at their core, rather than relying solely on financial means.

The Destructive Nature of Social Proof:
Social proof, the tendency to conform to the actions and beliefs of others, can have destructive consequences. The author expresses a disdain for stoicism and Sufism but suggests that living as a minimalist may help decrease the influence of social proof. By minimizing the desire for material possessions, individuals become less susceptible to the pressures of societal expectations. This rejection of social proof can foster individuality and critical thinking, which are essential for positive social change.

Economic Disparities and Property Rights:
The principle of the economic entity, often used to save and allocate capital, can inadvertently widen social gaps. The pursuit of property ownership, driven solely by the desire for gain, can lead to inflated housing prices. As a result, those in genuine need of affordable housing face significant challenges. Neoclassical liberalism argues that prices will naturally decrease if no one can afford the inflated rates. However, the power of demand often prevails, leaving the capitalist class unwilling to lower prices. This creates a cycle in which the financially vulnerable are forced to borrow money at high interest rates, further benefiting financial institutions at their expense.

The Impact on Marginalized Communities:
The inability to afford basic necessities and housing affects marginalized communities, leading to deficiencies in nutrition and education. When individuals lack the capacity to think critically due to these circumstances, they become susceptible to manipulation and exploitation. It becomes crucial to question whether the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, originated from disadvantaged communities. The intricate network of information dissemination, often exaggerated by influential media outlets, can amplify engagement, increase advertising revenue, and contribute to profit-seeking, all at the expense of truthful and balanced reporting.

The Cycle of Blame and Power Dynamics:
Powerful individuals often shift blame onto the very system they have created, perpetuating a self-reinforcing cycle. This cycle, likened to the mythical symbol of the ouroboros, symbolizes how those in power benefit from a system that produces and sustains the marginalized. By creating a narrative that blames the disadvantaged for their circumstances, the power dynamics remain intact while diverting attention away from systemic inequalities.

Conclusion:
The illusion of money and its limitations in trading ideology highlight the complex nature of societal challenges. Recognizing the destructive influence of social proof and economic disparities is crucial for promoting positive change. It is imperative to engage in critical thinking, challenge power dynamics, and strive for a more equitable society where the value of human life is not determined solely by monetary means. By understanding these complexities, we can work towards creating a more just and compassionate world for all.

the extinction of property rights: many people try to invest heavily in property, without necessity, only for gain, make the price of housing is higher, make someone who really need house hardly to afford. 

neoclassical liberalism said the price itself could become lower if no one can’t afford. but sometimes the demand is just too powerful. the capitalist won’t lowering the price because nothing to lose. 

people who demand it always try to afford. to borrow money from financial provider, even with high interest. 

financial firm is profited by this domination of some property capitalist. 

when the poor can’t afford something, they decrease other allocation for capital. it could be lack in food nutrition and education. when they don’t have the capacity to think, they are mostly driven by something illogical and can be easily tricked by someone. 

it could be interesting to do research if the first case of corona virus pandemic starts from poor community or not. the link, the network, itself could somehow be easily narrated exaggerately by big media. it could increase engagement, increase ads, increase profit, by ignites the reader's emotions.
