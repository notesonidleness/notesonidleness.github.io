Looking at the source above might make a little amazement at the development of science. That is, the development of the product and that theory can solve many neurological problems. But this is just the first step towards creating something "more" than this.

If we let ourselves think fictionally, or it's not fiction after all, what happened in a lot of science fiction films or books can happen in real life. From erasing memories in "Hujan" until like in Transcendence movie. It's not impossible, but it takes maybe a few hundred years or more, or less.

And based on fictional thinking such that, you're gonna accept everything that happened in your life. Even you will find that you're gonna enjoy and love all of your scarcities from your perspective.

Overthinking, insecurity, anxiety, depression, serious disease, and any other that people perceive as negative aspects will be enjoyed after seeing what might happen in the future. That all those things will disappear.

Painful memory can be eliminated, stress when thinking can be stopped, all things are easily obtained and eliminated. Everyone is forced by society or themself to be happy, not sick, clever, beautiful, and perfect. And there will be no more things that the majority of people perceive as illness or scarcity.

As neuroscience, computer science, and others develop into that way, you will be longing a lot of scarcities, dumbness, poorness, sadness, or disease. Based on doing fictional thinking such that you're gonna enjoy all your circumstances. And you're gonna conclude that,

Disease is not a bug. It's a feature.

Because in the future it's really easy to get something. You will be filled by dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, endorphins, and those kinds of things every time in the future with your expectation now. Now they spread with normal distribution statistically.

I never imagined if it's spread with uniform distribution with an infinity number. But if it still spreads with normal distribution, when in the future you always fill your brain with those kinds of things, you will get bored easily. Even with all of the fun variations, you will ask yourself,  
what's more?  
what's the point?

It could lead to a crisis of definition about what happiness and what human is. But in the future, you could trick your own brain so that you will not think about the crisis of definition.

Everything is easy to manipulate, create, update, or delete. Remembering or forgetting something is not a big deal. The joy of utopia is seemed imagination, but it close as we might think it be, we are even enjoying now which is the part towards the utopia.

But anyway we don't know what might happen in the future, maybe we're not gonna reach the utopia. Maybe we're extinct by catastrophe caused by ourselves such as climate change, pandemic, nuclear war, chemistry, or biology war. Or doomsday out of our reach.

Anyway, Fossil is extinct approximately until 2050 but alternative resources have been being developed until now. The sun is still shining until 10 billion years later and before that happens, we might understand how to move to another galaxy to find resources, or travel to another dimension, if we're not extinct by our war or doomsday.

Let's just think about what might happen in the future and you will find joy in all your circumstances now. You will love your thought, insecurities, mediocrity, being forgotten, loneliness, or any other negative aspects based on the perspective of life of majority .

And then, you can feel better about this life .  
Yes, with this fictional thinking,  
the human can feel better.  
Or even worse.

But what we are enjoying now is the products of fictional thinking from before, aren't they?
