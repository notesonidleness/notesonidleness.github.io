title: The Stagnation of LDK and Many College Organizations
---

Many LDK/rohis campus or organization in general seem to not be contributing much to the nation, or even to the university, or their respective departments/majors.

They tend to provide unurgent seminars, lack research tailored to the needs of their members, and make little effort to help all members reach their potential.

Most of what they do is conduct seminars that are mostly unhelpful, especially in areas where they lack deep knowledge of their religion. It's mostly just repetitive general advice that gets boring quickly.

They go on outings, hold overnight events, and focus on games just to entertain their 'members'. The members are pressured to attend these events, and if they don't follow the programs, they're labeled as apathetic. It's all superficial, not substantial, and wasteful. They always deny that they could do better.

Instead of doing things they don't understand like collecting donations or organizing seminars, they should maximize their potential. They have a lot of potential if they could truly integrate with their background, for example, in an informatics/IT context, they could brainstorm a lot of products for the Ministry of Religion. They could critically evaluate most of the systems they use, asking questions about 

- how https://simas.kemenag.go.id is built, 
- who built it?
- why the code isn't public?
- why it's not open source?
- What can we do to contribute to accelerating the program?

- How do you define the success metrics for a lot of public places of worship? 
- Is it only in terms of religious aspects, like the grandeur and quantity of places of worship?
- Could they contribute on a more fundamental level, like combating poverty, fighting gambling and destructive lending practices, or tackling social media addiction? 
- What kind of things can we contribute to this process?

Most Muslim tech enthusiasts could advocate and pressure the government to OPEN SOURCE the process of building. To integrate, because we'd like to know which areas are still lagging behind, not self-sufficient, and are facing hunger or are filled with criminal activity.

Compare this to doing something they don't understand, like protesting in politics or trying to act like an ulama. In terms of religion, just using the basics and following regular studies should be sufficient, because not everyone can be a dai, and mastering our subject is difficult. And if you maximize religious knowledge, then who will address these issues?

You're a bunch of rohis who watch anime and Korean dramas, filled with lots of Japanese, Korean, Western, dark, and weird music & ideologies caused by internet browsing. Just don't act like you're a pure Salafi who can act like a regular 'ponpes' student who have already experienced all sorts of supernatural things from their ustadz or 'sakti' friends.

The problem with rohis, and not just rohis, but most college organizations, is that I think they really like to engage in pseudo activism, like protests or something. When you protest to someone you don't know, and you know that the higher-ups are deaf, and you still protest, it means your brain is not functioning. So, it means the protest is just for show. Writing like I do might be considered a pseudo action too, but it's not for me because I only write when I can't sleep.

Teenagers from Rengasdengklok know exactly that their voices are useless, so they kidnapped the most powerful person they knew. We can be the Rengasdengklok gangs too, no need to protest. Let me give an example, focus on what you really want to focus on. Investigate and monitor one commission of the people's representative/ministry program in detail, gather all information about him/her, use the information, start a movement, and distribute what you find, and collaborate with many organizations.

If you're interested in finance, then go into finance. If it's public health, tech, politics, anthropology, law, and so on, then focus on those.

Sometimes pseudo activism is worse than inaction because you don't see the alternatives. You think you're already doing your best by doing a lot of things, while there are alternatives you don't see.

Inaction isn't really inaction if you can use your energy to research with a lot of effort to find problems. Like considering and thinking about how effective your organization really is in helping all its members. If you don't know the way and you say 'I just need to keep going,' you'll get lost, which will add to the cost of returning. We can pause for a moment, ask for directions from someone, or analyze first.

These things always come to my mind when I encounter someone who is hungry and struggling. Like, how is it possible that there are so many mosques but they still don't know that there are hungry people, that there are so many people struggling. It's not my responsibility, but I'm really afraid, what if it is our responsibility?

When I see people complaining, I see people like that. They create a story about their struggles and suddenly people donate to them online. I've had a few people try to sell me their stories, and the one I remember the most is from Tebet, 'kalo bundir ga dilarang agama gua bundir bang, anak2 gua dah ga pada peduli, susah bngt cari makan, mana mau servis motor doang kena tipu lagi...' But luckily, I'm a skeptical person and have been fooled many times because I've been friends with scammers and magicians, so I'm not easily swayed by things like that. But what if their condition is true? That's why I need data, I need standard operating procedures to verify.

- Who should I report my findings to? The nearest mosque or place of worship, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Religion? 
- How can I verify? 

This is the problem that could potentially be addressed by a unified data system and the integration of processes in the ministry. And this is why I really hate that most LDKs don't even see this. Their potential is so significant, and there's no critical discussion about it. 

What's the use of the information provided here? What action could be done after see this data?

But I think it's worth considering since most students struggle academically, so they need an organization to refresh and enjoy for a while. So it's just my problem then.

The thing is, I'm just curious about a summarized report of all mosques. I want it to be easily accessible like

, with many customizable metrics, to classify Muslims in Indonesia, their presentations, contributions, conflicts, and scandals, their relationships with political parties, and so on. Not limited to just social media trends like https://pers.droneemprit.id/ from @ismailfahmi, but any form of event.

I really have hope for abundant energy resources, so we can have plenty of computing and storage power, so that things like this, which are currently low-priority, can enrich the vision. The simplest thing I want is the source of truth, and the more painful the truth, the better.
