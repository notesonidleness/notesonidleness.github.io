title: Stone Collector

```text
When the times comes

You said that you wanna go home
To bear such peculiar nature
By the first time you step into the ocean
Collecting every single stone
Which you marked a wonder

You carry every single stone
That you consider a miracle
Fulfill all your pockets
Until they incriminated

You are go under your world
Stay in the depth
Until you forget to breathe
And to rise to the surface

You get used to not to breathe
Too comfortable collecting stones
Until you are tired
And ask why collecting stones

You convince yourself
The stone is something valuable
Never been found by anyone
Who faces peculiar feelings

You walk along the ocean
Until you find a place
Where many like you
Collecting stones

But their faces did not shine
Like a pearl smile
And so is your face you find
Then you said that you wanna go home

You believe in yourself
Home is not where you're come from
Home is somewhere you're supposed to be
And after looking out that scent now you realized

Where you're from and where you're supposed to be is doesn't matter
To collect stone, to collect sand
What's the difference?

Then you realize again

There is no place for those who faced peculiar nature
One sink in collecting stone or sand
And the other float in void flow
