title: "Smartband is a pain in the ass"
---

forget about singularity or flying cars; a smartwatch or smartband is a pain in the ass. #zonauang

- i need a dot/point device that i can paste anywhere on my body, like on an indian woman's forehead if you want to showcase the device, or those who prefer to hide their wealth; it can adhere anywhere on the body.

- the device can track all your movements and monitor the health of any part of your body. it's lighter than any gadget. 

- it can be integrated into any device, such as a smartphone, pc, or web browser.

- it shows you how healthy you are, vibrating if you need to stand up when sitting or sleeping too long, indicating stress levels and estimating life expectancy.

- it tracks the nutrients in the food you eat and calculates how many calories or nutrients you need.

- you can set long-term goals, and it generates a path of short-term goals and daily objectives for you to achieve those long-term goals.

- i don't care about the interface; it could be equipped with a waifu/husbandu ai or anything to scold you when you procrastinate or suggest breaks when you burn out or get tired.

- it helps you achieve your long-term goals and can be integrated into anything. it's lighter than dust and only needs low energy from what you eat.

- it automatically prompts you to speak the shahadat when you're dying.
