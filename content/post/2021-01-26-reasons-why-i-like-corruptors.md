"Am I a good teacher?"

"Yes", I said.

That is what you want to hear right?

In every corner of the world there is always corruption. Because a world without corruption is a boring world.

It is hard to strive for something called "The truth" when people rely so heavily on fakeness. While radical honestly can't be applied because there is something called offense that made people think irrationally, or what we called as emotion or heart or whatever it is.

Don't blame the new generation for their individualistic, rudeness, insecurity, unstable emotions, or hedonistic ways towards life. Because every character is nothing more than the derivatives of the ancestors and the environment.

It is not technology that made new generations seem like that. But technology just transparent everything by its excellence in dismantling something fake.

We must praise every corruptor who appears in front of the media. Many people blame the corruptors, but I rather praise them. They are just the representation of who we are exactly.

Every aspect is nothing more than supply and demand law.

Countries that supply corruption must have a lot of resources. Capitalists became richer and richer because there was always demand for their businesses. As long as we are unconscious about what we are doing, don't blame all the bad happened in this world, because we let that happen, individually or collectively.

Radical honesty can't be realized because people love lies and temporary matters. It is because people tend to search for something joyful and give them pleasure. Fundamentally, all the corruption or bad behavior of someone is always affected by people, by us. We legalize them to do so.

It happens when we're asked about our opinion towards the questioner. When we answer by answering against our logic, When we assume that our answer will hurt the questioner, from ethics it seems like the right action. But the self which really yearns for the truth has been corrupted.

When we're forced to do something we don't like and we're just doing that thing because someone told us to do so, that's where our souls are corrupted.

When we're in class, we study something we don't like with the boring lesson and boring teacher. When we act like we are enthusiastic about the lesson while the truth is we don't, that's when our souls are corrupted

When we consume something we don't need, we don't realize that it made the capitalist grow bigger. It made them possible to expand their businesses and bribe everyone so that they can expand their business.

When we are only able to shout, present ourselves as opponents, and feel proud of our attitude, the aspirations that we already know will go unheard, without realizing we have contributed to corruption.

When we don't fight, and just keep quiet, and stare at all the hypocrisy, that's when we are also one of the suppliers of the corruption.

Besides, what can we expect about the society that likes hypocrisy? Even those who claim to be moralists hide behind the cloak of 'ethics' and 'hospitality'. Whoever takes refuge between these robes will be free from all kinds of mistakes.

Feudalism never became extinct. It just turned into a form of excessive politeness. And it has happened until now. The rich are always wrong, the powerful are always wrong. The poor are always right, and the weak are always right. And in the end it just makes someone's stage gap to exploit something.

Radical honesty is nothing more than a joke. It is something delusional that silly and witty people expect.

What a foolish person blaming the corruptor! We should praise and adore the corruptors!

Never forget their services! Without them, we cannot feel like moralists!

Corruptors present us, ordinary people as moralists, as good people. They cover up all our corrupt acts, and endure the corruption that we have been doing.

So when a corruption case appeared in the media, I could only laugh and praise it. Haha, this is a product of corruption from me and my friends, thank you for hiding all the corruption that we've done
