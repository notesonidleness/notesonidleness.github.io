title: Review Brooks, 'The Shawshank Redemption'
---
Without realizing it, we are always part of something. And somehow that something must always be there and be a part of us. So when something is lost or feels far from our scope, we will always feel lost.

We are trying to find something, that something is missing. But when it turns out that the thing we are looking for is not found and we are desperate, then we look for something to replace it, but when we cling to what is missing, with all our despair and reluctance to move to other things, what is lost will destroy.

And that's how Brooks felt.

It is not explained how he got into the prison, but in prison he found something else that he did not find outside the prison. And that's when prison became his necessity.

Unlike Andy, he feels that the connection with him is not the jail, but beyond or out of the jail, or what as human perceive as freedom. But freedom for Brook is jail, because he longing and have been part of jail.

So when Brooks's prison term has ended, he is sad, and angry at anyone who said goodbye too him, even sincere farewell. He consider that as mock, or he perceives those behavior as rejecting him to be part of jail. Because jail was being part of him. And he want so bad live in jail, which people consider as restraint and crime, but Brook consider that as his freedom.

First, jail become the one which really be fear of by human. Then jail become one that really be enjoy by human. At first it is always avoided, but then it is be missing, like it is integrated with what is in it, and makes him feel part of it, and over time he doesn't want to lose it.

And that is applies with this pandemic.

It makes me ask, what's so bad about this, what makes humans yearn for something and become a part of something, whether it's civilization, or social, or heaven, or hell.

First, it makes us panic, longing for jokes, chats, and socializing with friends outside the home. But for some who make loneliness an integral part of it, this can cause panic when they knew that the pandemic will end.

And those who call themselves "normal" will admit that the strangest are those who panic when the pandemic ends. They are happy to be able to get together and have activities as usual again and wonder why some are so afraid and frustrated that they even think of these people as community trash, and making jokes on them.

And the decisive symptom or disease is the madness of society. Those who dominate always make everyone a part of them. This makes many who depend on the "domineering", deify domination, and loneliness is considered cowardice and a disease.

But when we ask the realm whose real disease is, are they the ones who dominate, or is it the one alone? Nature does not care about symptoms or diseases. It will and has been destroyed and reborn.

But what is the fate of those who yearn for something, who must always feel part of something, when what they miss is lost from it, when they feel lost.

Come back to something basics. What you miss, and what you want to be a part of. Do we always have to be a part of something that looks great, which is fantasized about being enormous?

What do humans want so that they always feel the need to be part of something? Isn't that the progress of civilization, or reverse engineering from something that has been formed into parts, pieces, or madness?

What do modern humans who are constantly looking for proof of small objective things want? Isn't it because they want to be part of something great?

And why the things Brooks missed seem trivial and lowly in comparison to the freedom Andy longed for. When he's guilty and fights badly, what is the difference between Andy and Brook?

What is clear, Brooks died because he was unable to remain in something he longed for, namely prison. And Andy fought prison with his heroic deeds that kept him alive. In the film Andy is seen to be alive. But is Andy really alive?

And why was Brooks looked so guilty when he's like Andy, like us, that with whatever we do, we just want to be a part of something .
