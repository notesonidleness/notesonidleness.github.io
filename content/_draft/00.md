intro

- i believe data driven society could make world a better place
- contagion ideas i have is economy post scarcity and economic based on donation
- if people behave by incentive, then the currency we have right now is obsolete. people will do everything to get the incentive. most advertisment and social media company driven by interaction and engagement, no matter how destructive itself by some perspectives, it continually incentivize those behaviour. to my mind it's not healthy in the long term. respect might be an alternative currency. 
but it is quite confusing because how we properly incentivize something or someone which deserve an incentive. 
and who are you to judge a content is constructive or destructive?
art itself is hard to valuate. 
what i would like to pursue abstractly is data driven society

Indonesia Religious Diversity Data Visualization: Indonesia is a diverse country, with six official religions and hundreds of ethnic groups2. You can use data from various sources, such as the [Statistics Indonesia], the [Pew Research Center], and the [World Religion Database], to visualize the distribution, composition, and trends of religious diversity in Indonesia. You can also use geospatial data and visualization tools, such as [GeoPandas] and [Folium], to create interactive maps and charts that show the spatial and temporal patterns of religious diversity in Indonesia. You can use this project to showcase your skills in data manipulation, data visualization, and geospatial analysis.
