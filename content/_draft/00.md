- i believe data driven society could make world a better place
- contagion ideas i have is economy post scarcity and economic based on donation
- if people behave by incentive, then the currency we have right now is obsolete. people will do everything to get the incentive. most advertisment and social media company driven by interaction and engagement, no matter how destructive itself by some perspectives, it continually incentivize those behaviour. to my mind it's not healthy in the long term. respect might be an alternative currency. 
but it is quite confusing because how we properly incentivize something or someone which deserve an incentive. 
and who are you to judge a content is constructive or destructive?
art itself is hard to valuate. 
what i would like to pursue abstractly is data driven society

bot answer:

A data-driven society has the potential to bring numerous benefits and contribute to making the world a better place. By utilizing data effectively, we can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions across various sectors, including healthcare, education, transportation, and environmental sustainability.

The idea of an economy post-scarcity is intriguing, where technology and automation have advanced to a level where basic needs can be met for everyone. This could free up resources and allow society to focus on other important aspects, such as personal development, creativity, and pursuing meaningful goals.

An economic system based on donation is another interesting concept. Instead of relying solely on traditional currency, a system that encourages people to contribute and support each other through voluntary giving could foster a more cooperative and compassionate society.

However, the challenge lies in properly incentivizing desirable behavior without compromising ethical values or causing unintended consequences. In the current digital landscape, many platforms and companies thrive on user engagement, often leading to addictive or destructive behaviors. Shifting the focus from engagement to more meaningful interactions and promoting healthy habits is crucial for the long-term well-being of individuals and society.

Finding alternative currencies like respect or other non-material forms of value is an intriguing idea. Valuing constructive contributions, fostering empathy, and encouraging positive interactions can be important steps towards building a more balanced and sustainable society. However, implementing and measuring such currencies can be complex, as the evaluation of constructive or destructive content can be subjective and influenced by individual perspectives.

Art, as you mentioned, is indeed challenging to evaluate. Its value often lies in its subjective interpretation and the emotions it evokes in individuals. Incorporating data-driven approaches in the arts can help understand patterns and preferences, but the true essence and impact of art may transcend quantitative measurements.

In the pursuit of a data-driven society, it's important to strike a balance between data utilization and preserving human values. Transparency, ethics, and inclusivity should be prioritized to ensure that data-driven decisions align with the broader goals of social progress, well-being, and sustainability.

Catatan kemalasan: Seni dan anti panduan untuk yang merasa bukan normal

4 kuadran optimistis, anda di posisi mana? (kata peter thiel)

1. definite pessimism: biasanya anda doomer

kebanyakan ngikutin greta thunberg, AI, nonton film2 kayak social dilemma (soundnya mengganggu)

2. indefinite pessimism: pengikut zizek

mikir sejauh apapun sulit untuk membayangkan. nah saya sendiri indefinite pessims, 
turkey problems (dan gajelas gitu kemananya) entah itu kesementaraan atau keabadian itu aneh2

maybe there is a light in the end of the tunnel, but there's also another train not realized they direct to us

nassim taleb: bukan masalah god is exist or not, what is the impact to you if its exist or not physically or metaphysically.
atau kaya film la haine (society is free fall)

3. indefinite optimism: orang yang menjalani hari2nya dengan normal

4. definite optimism: orang yang kekurangan data (kata sabrang leto)

if youre normal, its good for you. but sometimes youre just unnormal, alien. 
kaya nietzsche contohnya. biasanya orang2 yg termarjinalkan. secara mindset ia bisa sosial, tapi dia ga dapet enjoymentnya, tidak rewarding, karena biasanya doing shallow activities like happiness, perlu jadi conformist, ga bisa menikmati dan mensyukuri present moment, karena dibayangannya selalu ada injustice, war, social inequality yang terjadi, punya sedikit rasa humanis bahwa its not right to be happy, because your time can be valuable if we thinking about the nature, what can we act to reduce human entrophy. they have messiah complex

stoicism biasanya jadi anti thesis pemikiran kaya gini "do something you can control". but its not work for me. i always curious about something beyond, and stoicism is written by already the emperor, you can't be stoic if you're a luddite/weakman/normal person. dan kalo di islam ada ayat "youre not responsible for anybody's fault" yg menjustifikasi gausah terlalu care sama yg gabisa dikontrol, tapi di satu sisi ada juga fastabiqul khoirat, perlu lomba2 dalam kebaikan. 

i always afraid. fear is something push we, don't give me cheap optimism like "youre enough, love yourself". no! i always reflect what if am wrong, what if im lied by anything, science or religion, what if they lied to me, and what matter is what is the impact for me? what is the impact to them if i accepted/rejected the lies?

and stil, the first thing to do is survival first, and second you can validate the lies.

devaluasi materi dan asumsi ilusi. kaum termarjinalkan adalah noda kecil di pakaian yang harus dikucek sampe hilang.

cara menguceknya adalah memberikan pil soma melalui deal with the devil dengan strict data driven yang entahlah siapa yang punya otoritas. 

yg punya kunci itu pastilah mayoritas omnipoten yang tidak terbantahkan, vox populi vox dei. 

dan apabila kamu noda, sedangkan kamu tidak ingin hilang, kamu harus pura-pura cinta dengan deterjen dan pemutih.

hanya dengan cara itulah kamu bisa menjadi transenden dan disucikan.

the answer to that is social credit system, but since the words itself is berkonotasi buruk, we could replace the name as religious acceleration/akselerasi smart city melalui masjid berprestasi or whatever named you want. 

"this the era where complexity arouses, you must become specialize, and die. one or 2 intersect subjects could really help, but too many, you could end up become an obsolete polymath."

if in ccp they underrate or indifferent towards religion, in indonesia the focus is religion as their ciri khasnya.

1. gerakan mahasiswa muslim di tiap univ menjadi inisiatornya. seperti gamais, karisma salman itb, dan hirokoba, 
mereka perlu stop kegiatan dakwah formalitas useless. 

mereka menjadi data tech organization yang berusaha mendata dan mempropagandakan SMAs SMPs untuk revolusi tiap masjid di indonesia. 

the key words is always, 'integration'

penggulingan boomer dan golongan tua, mereka hanya perlu jadi penasihat saja, dan harus selalu ada regenerasi dan improvement masjid inovatif. 

mengajak para tech dan muslim untuk melakukan anarkis, agar siapapun di sektor apapun transparansi semua anggaran dan semua aset pemerintahan.

pengembangan aplikasi wajib open source dan dapat dilihat secara publik sehingga kode buruk bisa dilihat dan banyak yang bisa pull request untuk memperbaiki. 

literasi digital dan literasi data nomor satu.

1/ first digitalizing all mosque systems, by training all outdated management system. pada sebelumnya, all things did manually and only announce only in hari2 besar. but  the new semuanya dicatat di dalam sistem, untuk menunjukkan rank tiap masjid seperti saham.

i bet their market is very high, even though not as high as stock market, ,the transparency could make society feels empower. ** ss ajaib

2. social credit in tingkat individu. all praise by knowledge, with basic like anies baswedan said, someone who contribute much to farm, education, they are rewarded and rank in the first, minimizing people act stupidly in tiktok and twitter (me as an example) only to gain incentive.

how about art like game that is hardly to quantify?

fuck art. art itself always finds its place, its rich in its own way.

3. social credit di tingkat individu itu juga membatasi individu untuk bermain dan pursuit of cheap happiness lainnya. **grafik diagram, ending game addiction and makes company collapses vs wasting young man time

social status orang yg liburan ke luar negeri (tanpa tujuan penting seperti edukasi atau mempromosikan negara) direndahkan, propagandakan bahwa para tki dan eksportir sudah sulit membawa devisa ke sini, maka suatu ketoloan apabila kita liburan ke luar. 

mereka wajib berinvestasi untuk membangun daerahnya masing-masing dan membangun pariwisatanya daerahnya untuk berkmebang, atau apabila ingin berlibur maksimal adalah di dalam negeri.

di lingkungan masjid anak2 sedari dini bereksperimen build things dan entrepeneurship bukan hanya terbatas pada makanan dan pakaian, tapi produk2 teknologinya seperti membuat drone, cctv, produk2 iot, robot, bahkan reaktor nuklir dan inovasi lainnya yang mengatasi lingkungannya. 

setiap rt rw memiliki 'JIRA' nya masing-masing. semuanya dapat melaporkan backlog yang berupa masalah yang dihadapinya. seluruh masyarakat bisa melihat masalah itu dan apabila ingin membantu menyelesaikan masalah tersebut, credit dr contributor tersebut akan naik. 

sistem ini mendukung fitur anonimitas, sehingga apabila ada tetangga yang bakar sampah sembarangan atau dangdutan dan hajatan keras2 nutup jalan warga, orang lain bisa tau, dan pelaku dapat dikurangi credit scorenya. 

minoritas dapat memprotes berisiknya toa masjid yang berperasi di jam tidak lazim.

proses pengurangan credit score itu bisa bergantung pada suatu 'hakim' atau voting dan musyawarah masyarakat.

orang hikkikomori dapat dideteksi karena dalam sistem itu semuanya telanjang, masyarakat bisa melihat apa saja, seperti apa yang expertise dan interestnya, berapa persen waktu hidupnya yang digunakan untuk ia mengejar cita2nya atau justru terdistraksi dalam berbagai aktivitas yang tidak penting yang menjauhkannya dari minat dan bakatnya.

ada wwe untuk membahas salafi vs NU, bidah dan tidak bidah. event organizer lebih kreatif ga cuman konser.

apabila ada pengemis, maka pengemis tersebut dilaporkan ke masjid terdekat untuk didata, lahir dimana dan bagaimana hubungan dengan keluarganya. masjid empowering agar pengemis itu bisa hidup mandiri dan terus provided kebutuhan dasarnya apabila belum dapat ahli atau masih bangkrut.

dibandingkan bukit algortima yang mangkrak dan bersifat elitist centralistik, maka social credit system berdasarkan masjid ini sifatnya lebih decentralize dan egaliter

indonesia apabila orang2 tech dan MBA jadi marbot masjid 

i want to write a novel like daerah salju yasunari kawabata, but university ruins me by mencekokiku dengan formalitas pendidikan dari kuliah metodologi mppi, so it turns out it is like dokumentasi analisis dan perancangan sistem informasi, yang gagal aku ikutkan ke gemastik di tahun pandemi karena tulisanku seperti orang obsessed terhadap sesuatu dan terlalu mabuk sehingga aku gagal marketing my ideas and objective to para sapi di rumah penggilingan. 

philosopher now is abundance, young tends to be more in home and give up, worlds become boring is everyone is philosopher, but the democratization of knowledge makes everyone become philosopher. hikkikomori is filsuf. if i called 'home' to any place on earth which i find solace, then it means i always home because i am a cosmopolitan... thus i am a hikkikomori by nature...

but even in a moderate there's always a invinsible kutub

invinsible hand that forces us to buy things we dont' need to impress people we dont like by money we dont have. invinsible hand that makes us believe that we are moderate while the truth, we are not. we are menyimpang, we stray further from the zero everyday

"never participate in reciprocal gratitude, make people question everything and make them never feel enough. the dalil is fastabiqul khairat"

some media frame that is how the bomb terrorist school of thought, simplification, misinterpret, and whatnot. they said a simple claim with high variance could model the bigger picture. having sense a big objectivity, they turn some pictures and words to become their profit. 

anyone cant blame them because they want to be the top media companies, their employee need works to provide their kids at home. 

a lot big corpo, drill down to individual with overprice salary, they feel never enough, because they see whats coming for them, like what happened to nokia, blueberry, xerox, and so on. 

some complaint someone about being too greedy, or too arrogant, is just inferior. the worst effect about envy is to make someone who can show off her greedy hide themselves to hide their luck and fortune. 

"Dari Ma ' mar ia berkata, Rasul SAw bersabda: barang siapa yang menimbun barang, maka ia bersalah ( berdosa )" ( HR Muslim ).

how can someone measure the things become grateful or arrogant? there's no absolute measure, only relative to who you are compare to.

thats why to show off is a must, to share that you have good foods, companies, places, friends, family. show all your works and your result, even your dumbest  idea. there's always a room for sharing.

gaps in social economy is never problem in islam. the problem is occured when some can't afford the basic needs for survival so they suffered with no potential to growth. if there's no problem about that, then no problem at all. 

the thing is gaps will always contribute to envy. and the OUROBOROS appeared. some cant afford basic needs & want and envy to the powerful, then the powerful fear of been tearing down so she hide themself. 

overtax the overpower is just nonsense too, there's no guarantee that they could profit all the time. and when they go broke, there's no bail out, unless youre too big too fail like the speculators.

thats why the number one of corporate rule is to "monopoly", because basically everyone is just scared, fear is the fundamental of everything. this day tiktok is become the scapegoat to comfort their competitor.

even when a few trying to make fear become certain, with over data-driven like china, there's no guarantee at all that it would not collapse. it's all just about taking a choice. act as if you have a free will, but judge others as if they dont, because you can't never emphatize with autist and psycopath.

there's always a room for change and improvement, except for the people you already hate.

its rare to see bromance like averroes and algazel this day. writing is often misinterpreted. seminars and debates are full of drama, too long and boring

fuck i need platform to burry dreams

its such a shame people dont announce their dead dreams

the things is we dont know what kind of creature dream is. most people see dream as dead unliving thing, when it died, then it doesnt have value anymore. 

but i see dream as a creature, it could be like human, or it could be like fruits. there's a seed that die or when we burry it will grow. thats why i think people should announce their dead dream. 

because there's a chance we can't exploit the dead. the dead can't speak, so we should exploit them for our profit and gain, to collect the heritage. 

if we dont burry it, it really stinks, it is distracting me so much.

i have talk too much about this thing and none of it result in action. she's dying because i expect much about her. and this announcement is my apologize for her, for burdening her with so much expectation. 

here's i announce my dead dreams. please anyone come to her funeral. we dont know what kind of creature she is. we dont know whther she is mati suri or she want to rest in peace. but the things to do now is we should burry her. 

i dare you all to announce your dead dreams, burrry them, and let them do what their desire.

Innalillahi Wainnailihi rojiun.
