intro

- i believe data driven society could make world a better place
- contagion ideas i have is economy post scarcity and economic based on donation
- if people behave by incentive, then the currency we have right now is obsolete. people will do everything to get the incentive. most advertisment and social media company driven by interaction and engagement, no matter how destructive itself by some perspectives, it continually incentivize those behaviour. to my mind it's not healthy in the long term. respect might be an alternative currency. 
but it is quite confusing because how we properly incentivize something or someone which deserve an incentive. 
and who are you to judge a content is constructive or destructive?
art itself is hard to valuate. 
what i would like to pursue abstractly is data driven society

Indonesia Religious Diversity Data Visualization: Indonesia is a diverse country, with six official religions and hundreds of ethnic groups2. You can use data from various sources, such as the [Statistics Indonesia], the [Pew Research Center], and the [World Religion Database], to visualize the distribution, composition, and trends of religious diversity in Indonesia. You can also use geospatial data and visualization tools, such as [GeoPandas] and [Folium], to create interactive maps and charts that show the spatial and temporal patterns of religious diversity in Indonesia. You can use this project to showcase your skills in data manipulation, data visualization, and geospatial analysis.

the biggest problem is i think toxic/blind postivity. it is not related to mental health but bigger than that. 

so here's the problems, 

its like this counterintuitive: whenever you're in a job, when you're more competent or more efficient than other coworkers, then what will you get?

yes you will get the punishment, you'll get more job to do. the incentive just stay the same. 

and the toxic entreprenerial blind mindset said, "oh you should become an entrepreneur so you work for yourselve instead of others." without considering

- Access to Capital
- Regulatory Barriers
- Market Competition
- Networking and Connections
- Education and Skills Gap
- Inequality and Discrimination
- Technology Access
- Bureaucratic Challenges
- Healthcare and Social Safety Nets
- Environmental Sustainability
- Global Economic Uncertainty

the thing is economy is obsolete. all science is expanding and developing, but economy just stay the same, no significant system update. automation/robotic process, they are cheaper, faster. 

then its just a time, when only the most who has capital that survive, the rich getting richer and otherwise.

we need new currency, new economy. crypto? meh, cryptocurrency & decentralize finance things is just making us easier to rob each other.

why UBI never be experiment?? what is challenge to post scarcity? we are just doing somehting, watching, and without realization that the monster become bigger. why? that's because toxic positivity from those who are in comfort gaslight all like, "no, we are safe, far from that", "it's okay, there's always an opportunity.", "dont' be lazy! hardwork! stay positive. you will get success"

love is like proving method in math and i fuckin hate proving method.

why can't it just be intuitive speculation, why we need to prove. 

why can't we see many forms of love. 

being ignored is a form of love. 
marahnya ibu adalah cita. 
tsunami dan gempa bumi menandakan cinta mereka untuk bersatu dengan korbannya
kebencian adalah salah satu bentuk cinta

mengapa harus ada batasan dalam mencintai, mengapa perlu ada pembuktian.

>
maka generative AI telah merusak itu semua. membuat tulisan seakan usang, bahwa tulisan menjadi abundance dan usang. ia membuktikan bahwa kata-kata bukanlah bukti. dengan mudah kata-kata menjadi sempurna berkatnya. hingga ia menunjukkan pada kita, bahwa bukanlah kesempurnaan bukti yang kita inginkan, kita ingin kecacatan, kita ingin suatu hal yang rapuh, yang tidak sempurna. 

barangkali ia menjadi bukti mengapa pada hari akhir nanti semuanya tertunduk pada karisma ketidaksempurnaan dajjal. bahwa kita telah ditipu untuk menginginkan kesempurnaan. bahwa yang rapuh itulah sebenarnya yang kita dambakan.

i hate the sound of rain
i hate the sound of loud music
i hate the sound of short clip tiktok
i hate the sound of tipping keyboard
it is noisy
i hate all sounds
how can i ignore all sounds
i am just too sensitive to sounds
every whisper i try to ignore
my ears are just too keen to all that whisper
how can i ignore
i dont want to hear
i know i will not respond to all that sounds
but these ears are just too susceptible
i know nothing important
but these ears still try to catch the wave
how can i close these ears
im tired of all sounds
i only want to hear sounds under water
no sign or language
no things i should respond

im enough of sounds
i am coward to respond
i want to hear sound only underwater
i want to hear no sound
so i don't need to catch the complex wave
so i dont have to act
---
I despise the patter of raindrops' dance,
Loathe the thunderous beats of music's trance.
The fleeting TikTok whispers, brief and sly,
Assault my senses, make me wonder why.

A cacophony of keys, a tip-toeing storm,
Noisy symphony, my patience they deform.
In this realm of sound, I find no peace,
Averse to every note, my solace seeks release.

How do I shroud my ears, escape this din,
A sensitivity to sound, my Achilles' skin?
Whispers, like secrets, I try to evade,
Yet my keen ears catch the symphony they've made.

I yearn to silence the clamor, find a retreat,
But my ears, like sentinels, remain on the beat.
In pursuit of tranquility, I strive to be free,
Yet the world's orchestra keeps haunting me.

A weary soul, drowning in the noise,
I long for a haven, a soundless poise.
Beneath the waves, where silence reigns,
No languages to decipher, no need for refrains.

Enough of this discord, I yearn to be numb,
A coward to the sounds, a silence I'd become.
Underwater melodies, the only ones I crave,
No complex waves to surf, no need to be brave.

Let me escape this realm of resonating fears,
To the hushed world below, where serenity appears.
No need to respond, no need to react,
Just the muffled sounds of a submerged act.

lets be honest. 
1. first option: being a marbot masjid.
do you really believe that people you could fold the fabric of reality? by making people believe on what you said, on what you doctrine? to speak in front of people, you should do this or do that. you should pray to god and so on, do you really want to tell people to do something? i believe you dont. 

you see your friends. they only care about themselves, they want to be the star. only conspiracay thoeries beleive in your words. none fall for machiavelli words for reward and punishment. everyone just irationally believe in the guilty some ethical nonsense after been doctrinated from the first year of their childhood. and it doesnt really effect them in the long run. they just believe in this capitalism, that you have a dream, that you can be anything. 

so most teenager just believe in whatever they saw in movies, short clips, songs, news, whatever being taught to them, without consciousness or realization. your college friends, include you just look for something that make them feel great, while the truth is, noone knows the truth. the truth just doesn't exist. and while you are forcing your problems to them, they are just don't care about it. so you think it is feasible? yes it is. but you're a part of munafiqun, dont try to speak in front of people something you don't do by yourself!

2. second option: data engineer/industrial clerk work.
pursuing data engineer, computer science, information system in general. you fuckin hate it. you know it. when someone request you to do something, industrial things, it is all meaningless. first you got an intern at one of big company in OTA, you somehow feel grateful. then you're just go into it, you feel like shit. all meaningless, all bullshit jobs, that anyone can do that. why the recruitment process is such hell? 

you try to keep it up, try to focus on data engineering. but the things it you dont care about it. you experienced as backend engineer or frontend, designing some information system , drawing process, chart, analysis nonsense. you fuckin hate it. you enjoy the coding for a little while, but in the end you know that it is meaningless. it is too little. 

maybe someday you might find enjoyment in it, but not with people tell you need to do something. you fucking hate user so much. they are scum stupid people fucking lazy to read and to learn, so they are just fucking asking everything while it s so ffcking obvious. you hate all those creators, all users, you hate much of those. 

you want to work with someone you admire. none of it you admire. what is the impact for society, they are just scum who fall for american dream and just build a happy family. their family are superficial, their kids are stupid. they tell their kids to memorizing random arabian words what for? to show their stupid friends that their kids is fucking religious. it's moron you know, memorizing something you don't understand, and you believe it will make a goodness to you. but yes, it is goodness, you pretend that it is good, then it will become good in the end. fake it till you make it my ass.

would you continue pursuing data engineer or industrial clerk in general my friends? i believe you dont want. 

3. option 3: quant.
ah this another bullshit jobs. you sure knows that trader is just a fucking moron who believe in astrology. you know from mandelbrot or munger that it is fucking stupid. no real value. financial engineering is just stupid and doesnt create any value. their richness is stupid. they can buy real things, but there's no value in it, it is all illusions. they are all gambler, you want to end up like them? i dont thing so. 

but you somehow dream to be well financially independent, so you can do anything you want. i think it is just a start to be rich quickly other than other options. but how do you continue this.

4. option 4: nuclear, complexity science, all physical mathematical geek things.

you aim to be one of this. what for? what kind of problem do you want to solve? you just want a fancy title, aren you? youre fuckin bad at math. you jsut memorizing math, not understanding math. you got C+ at statistics.

but you really want to do this? please clarify, what problems do you want to solve. thats the biggest question. it stimulates your brain i believe. but is there the thing you really like to solve? you need to clarify.

1. option 5: food self-sufficiency.

i dont know you really want to start farming or agriculture? i think you consider option 3 not because you really want it, but rather you just want to have image of independece that you could suffice yourself without the need of others so you can do something in number 4. am i right? but you simply are afraid to fail. you dont know how start, you dont know how to research. you need to buy land. there's no guaranteed that it will success.

so what's the concrete things you should do? clarification

- try datazoomcamp whether you hate it or not
- find problems to solve
- see forage
- research about how to be self-sufficient and fight the feeling of afraid and insecurity towards lack of something.

after arsjad rasyid endgame podcast

i imagine myself, goes traveling through all indonesia. selfies.

this why i prefer cities human-made more than natures god-made

- nature is something perfect, but there is something progress in human made.
- i hate genius/priviledged for they lack of beauty of effort. something that makes it beautiful is the effort
- "back to nature" as we should climb to mountain or beach, but actually we can always go back in nature, to go true deep of ourselves, to go around city, to talk with friends, to see movies, or to go through neighborhood. it doesn't have to be nature god-made. 
- nature now become part of traveller/lazy tourism management doctrinal that even you're ok enjoy yourself stay at room / village, then they say it means you're not happy normal person. 
- city has so much diversity. some accept it some dont. individuality is embraced.

- mandelbrot fractalian at first is elegant, but some degraded or devaluing the human part of development. 
- 2-bit, square, aristotlian, minecraft graphic is perfect. surely cloud <is not sphered>, ** and so on. but god-made is already perfect. they lack of appreciation to the process. 
- al ghazali scepticism to science at that time is comprehensible, since at that time they follow blindly science, not realize that science is as capacable as lying as religion. science itself is religion. but to say that there's no cause and effect except from god is somehow uncomprehensible by the limitation of human mind.  
- ** ghibli, some say farm nature is beauty, but it is human made.
- square, vertical, efficient building is just as beauty as the complexity mountain or line beach, or anything inside human organs. 
- minecraft is beauty

- it is make sense that dajjal become influential even it's imperfectness, they claim to be gods even they are ugly as fuck. 
- they preach that AI that makes binary, words, images, sounds, just too perfect are not alive. they accuse the perfectness as part of pride and arrogance.
- so they just exclaimed, "accept yourself as you are", "be yourself!", "be authentic!". its okay to be stupid, poor, ugly, at least you're happy. These preaches are also preached by mujahid, so that they look like mujahids, while the truth is they dont.
- their reasoning flaws made them see everything just the same, they can't differentiate good and evil, they believe there's always intersection makes them complement each others.
- dajjal struggle to conceptualize the concept of heaven because they think somebody's heaven is somebody's hell. 
- dajjal see/hears/smell,taste, some only want their one true love in heaven, some want do orgies with multi races in heaven. some want to be individual, some want to be in comunal. 
- dajjal see contradictions in heaven's expectations, they condescending the wants or needs of others, while they perceive that ultimate form of incentive is just knowledge, because they don't have power.
- they dont have power to be intelligence, wealth, and beauty. they only have the knowledges. and the false assumptions of them is to be sure that there's no worthy of pursuing heaven, all meaningless. what they knew is only hell, because of their lust to knowledge.
- dont fall for dajjal, my friends.

you may prefer cities or nature.
but i prefer follow instruktur senam arruhul jaddid.

this year i have distro hopped to ubuntu, fedora, and manjaro.

i tried ubuntu 22.04 LTS but i hate old gnome.

fedora is good though but i stil feel something is off.

i think manjaro is perfect, but i hate arch-based.

now i go back to ubuntu 23.10. i hope it wont brake my laptop.

and i still havent figured out why my laptop is freeze when i enable suspend mode.
the simple trick is just i disable all suspend mode. now luck is just fine.

i suspect there's something wrong with kernel, or ssd driver, or graphic driver. 

i tried look journal, but stil dont know whats the problem fuck, im so noob.

you need to join cult, trying multiple cult,

until you get cult with greatest sense of belonging

try to be diversed

then you realize the preach, we have to unite is a futile doctrine.

'i already content with this group'

the group has various numbers, it variance is big. even there's someone who content with only 1 number in group, 
even a half, even a quarter, even empty or void.

the idea of diversity is bullshit. 

those who dont find cult that they found complacent wont go anywhere

they become the cosmopoliton, dont belong to any cult

but once they find their cult, they are all shouting...

more isolation please!!!

Memory is unrealiable

fuck man i have just experienced this. 

i met my crush when i was in 6th grade elementary school on a train in the today. 

i recognize her face and ask her, "are you [...insert name]?"

and she completely clueless about me like i met with my alzheimer grandma.

i remember in 6th grade, i ride bicycle +- 5KM with friends, my friend gave me toblerone to give to her. 

i even wrote a poem. i went to her house, met her little brother, we ask him to tell his sister to come because i want to give her something.

than she came out the house to her neighbor house in right side of her house. 

we were shy but finally I dared to speak from outside the neighbor's fence.

"i like you" and i give her the tobleront with my poem. 

then i and my friends run away comeback to my friend's house.

---

the question is whether my memory is reliable or not, or her memory?

or i dont learn and experience present much enough so i can still remember the past.

or each person has a memory weight that make it erase completely based on weight?

like it is trivial for me but i still remmber the detail.

does my memory really extrapolate and excessively distort the real story?

then i found the same case with this movie,

When you're a smartest person in your room, you realize you'll hate yourself because it means you're in the wrong room. You see news and hear speaks from other people that most of their smartest friend end up doing nothing compare to their most bastard friend. 

I saw reddit questions: What stopped you from killing yourself?

And here is my answer. 

I hate smart gifted kids as I hate older who see their smart gifted friends fail in life. 

I learn everyday to avoid become them. I don't want to be a book smart, to be a number one in academic. But it turned out my lust for recognition is higher than my ability to suppressed my desire. So I try everything I can to secure my position as someone who look smart in the number. And I knew it is all lie. You can easily manipulate everything in order to be number one. It's not the number one that you should aim, but rather in the process of searching that is matter. 

Thats why I hate it. I don't want to be like them. I need to find my way. I don't want any smartest kid in their room feel dismal because of their loneliness. I want them to feel that their loneliness is power. That loneliness that power them to create something. The anxiety that boost them to break the limit of everything so they can see what anyone can't see. It should be something that empower them to create something miracle monster. 

Thats why I need to remember my enemy. I don't desire friends. I desire enenmy, for they make me feel alive only to crush them. I need them more than my friends. I don't desire happiness. I desire revenge.
