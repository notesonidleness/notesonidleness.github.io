- i believe data driven society could make world a better place
- contagion ideas i have is economy post scarcity and economic based on donation
- if people behave by incentive, then the currency we have right now is obsolete. people will do everything to get the incentive. most advertisment and social media company driven by interaction and engagement, no matter how destructive itself by some perspectives, it continually incentivize those behaviour. to my mind it's not healthy in the long term. respect might be an alternative currency. 
but it is quite confusing because how we properly incentivize something or someone which deserve an incentive. 
and who are you to judge a content is constructive or destructive?
art itself is hard to valuate. 
what i would like to pursue abstractly is data driven society

bot answer:

A data-driven society has the potential to bring numerous benefits and contribute to making the world a better place. By utilizing data effectively, we can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions across various sectors, including healthcare, education, transportation, and environmental sustainability.

The idea of an economy post-scarcity is intriguing, where technology and automation have advanced to a level where basic needs can be met for everyone. This could free up resources and allow society to focus on other important aspects, such as personal development, creativity, and pursuing meaningful goals.

An economic system based on donation is another interesting concept. Instead of relying solely on traditional currency, a system that encourages people to contribute and support each other through voluntary giving could foster a more cooperative and compassionate society.

However, the challenge lies in properly incentivizing desirable behavior without compromising ethical values or causing unintended consequences. In the current digital landscape, many platforms and companies thrive on user engagement, often leading to addictive or destructive behaviors. Shifting the focus from engagement to more meaningful interactions and promoting healthy habits is crucial for the long-term well-being of individuals and society.

Finding alternative currencies like respect or other non-material forms of value is an intriguing idea. Valuing constructive contributions, fostering empathy, and encouraging positive interactions can be important steps towards building a more balanced and sustainable society. However, implementing and measuring such currencies can be complex, as the evaluation of constructive or destructive content can be subjective and influenced by individual perspectives.

Art, as you mentioned, is indeed challenging to evaluate. Its value often lies in its subjective interpretation and the emotions it evokes in individuals. Incorporating data-driven approaches in the arts can help understand patterns and preferences, but the true essence and impact of art may transcend quantitative measurements.

In the pursuit of a data-driven society, it's important to strike a balance between data utilization and preserving human values. Transparency, ethics, and inclusivity should be prioritized to ensure that data-driven decisions align with the broader goals of social progress, well-being, and sustainability.

4 kuadran optimistis, anda di posisi mana? (kata peter thiel)

1. definite pessimism: biasanya anda doomer

kebanyakan ngikutin greta thunberg, AI, nonton film2 kayak social dilemma (soundnya mengganggu)

2. indefinite pessimism: pengikut zizek

mikir sejauh apapun sulit untuk membayangkan. nah saya sendiri indefinite pessimist, 
turkey problems (dan gajelas gitu kemananya) entah itu kesementaraan atau keabadian itu aneh2

maybe there is a light in the end of the tunnel, but there's also another train not realized they direct to us

nassim taleb: bukan masalah god is exist or not, what is the impact to you if its exist or not physically or metaphysically.
atau kaya film la haine (society is free fall)

3. indefinite optimism: orang yang menjalani hari2nya dengan normal

4. definite optimism: orang yang kekurangan data (kata sabrang leto)

if youre normal, its good for you. but sometimes youre just unnormal, alien. 
kaya nietzsche contohnya. biasanya orang2 yg termarjinalkan. secara mindset ia bisa sosial, tapi dia ga dapet enjoymentnya, tidak rewarding, karena biasanya doing shallow activities like happiness, perlu jadi conformist, ga bisa menikmati dan mensyukuri present moment, karena dibayangannya selalu ada injustice, war, social inequality yang terjadi, punya sedikit rasa humanis bahwa its not right to be happy, because your time can be valuable if we thinking about the nature, what can we act to reduce human entrophy. they have messiah complex

stoicism biasanya jadi anti thesis pemikiran kaya gini "do something you can control". but its not work for me. i always curious about something beyond, and stoicism is written by already the emperor, you can't be stoic if you're a luddite/weakman/normal person. dan kalo di islam ada ayat "youre not responsible for anybody's fault" yg menjustifikasi gausah terlalu care sama yg gabisa dikontrol, tapi di satu sisi ada juga fastabiqul khoirat, perlu lomba2 dalam kebaikan. 

i always afraid. fear is something push we, don't give me cheap optimism like "youre enough, love yourself". no! i always reflect what if am wrong, what if im lied by anything, science or religion, what if they lied to me, and what matter is what is the impact for me? what is the impact to them if i accepted/rejected the lies?

and stil, the first thing to do is survival first, and second you can validate the lies.
