- i believe data driven society could make world a better place
- contagion ideas i have is economy post scarcity and economic based on donation
- if people behave by incentive, then the currency we have right now is obsolete. people will do everything to get the incentive. most advertisment and social media company driven by interaction and engagement, no matter how destructive itself by some perspectives, it continually incentivize those behaviour. to my mind it's not healthy in the long term. respect might be an alternative currency. 
but it is quite confusing because how we properly incentivize something or someone which deserve an incentive. 
and who are you to judge a content is constructive or destructive?
art itself is hard to valuate. 
what i would like to pursue abstractly is data driven society

bot answer:

A data-driven society has the potential to bring numerous benefits and contribute to making the world a better place. By utilizing data effectively, we can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions across various sectors, including healthcare, education, transportation, and environmental sustainability.

The idea of an economy post-scarcity is intriguing, where technology and automation have advanced to a level where basic needs can be met for everyone. This could free up resources and allow society to focus on other important aspects, such as personal development, creativity, and pursuing meaningful goals.

An economic system based on donation is another interesting concept. Instead of relying solely on traditional currency, a system that encourages people to contribute and support each other through voluntary giving could foster a more cooperative and compassionate society.

However, the challenge lies in properly incentivizing desirable behavior without compromising ethical values or causing unintended consequences. In the current digital landscape, many platforms and companies thrive on user engagement, often leading to addictive or destructive behaviors. Shifting the focus from engagement to more meaningful interactions and promoting healthy habits is crucial for the long-term well-being of individuals and society.

Finding alternative currencies like respect or other non-material forms of value is an intriguing idea. Valuing constructive contributions, fostering empathy, and encouraging positive interactions can be important steps towards building a more balanced and sustainable society. However, implementing and measuring such currencies can be complex, as the evaluation of constructive or destructive content can be subjective and influenced by individual perspectives.

Art, as you mentioned, is indeed challenging to evaluate. Its value often lies in its subjective interpretation and the emotions it evokes in individuals. Incorporating data-driven approaches in the arts can help understand patterns and preferences, but the true essence and impact of art may transcend quantitative measurements.

In the pursuit of a data-driven society, it's important to strike a balance between data utilization and preserving human values. Transparency, ethics, and inclusivity should be prioritized to ensure that data-driven decisions align with the broader goals of social progress, well-being, and sustainability.

A little things are effecting me, I passed zuhr prayer due to irrational thought process. I'm atheist. I'm atheist, I scream to myself. But that scream is usually just a lie. There's always a burden feeling when I missed my prayer. I fucked up my sleep schedule. In Depok I always feel hot and can't sleep early. Sometimes I listen to random youtube videos or audiobook or almatsurat, but it's hard to work for me. I don't want to use air conditioner because of global warming (I'm poor) and electric fan never works. I want places and public transportations like Jakarta with night weather like in Cimahi. A couple of months ago I went to Kuningan, and the air felt so fresh. I could sleep comfortably without air conditioner there. But here in Depok, I hardly fell asleep. I make a schedule that I should sleep at 9 PM, but in the end I just scrolling down twitter or instagram and fell asleep at 1 or 2 AM. I don't know how to fix this. I want to do routine like a Muslim, do tahajud, go to mosque each prayer, even I don't know what things I need to pray. The things I should pray if god exist is I want my family forgets me, that they don't need to remember they got a devil yongest son, so I can kill myself freely. I don't have intention or desire like most people. I gaslight myself that I just want the truth, I don't care about happiness of others or myself, I don't need to be happy, I always convince myself like that. I really hate that I should make a phony talk to my parents. I need to tell them that I healthy when they ask me how is it going. I hate to pretend to laugh when someone talk the jokes I don't understand, but at the same time I need to laugh so they at least have a sensible feeling that they can make other people happy. I really hate that I need hold myself to laugh when someone making dark jones about cripple people, poor people, or someone in a war condition. I want to laugh only when I need to. I remember the moment my friends reciting his quran to rememorizing his quran. I suddenly cried at that, and I think it was the moment when I cried genuinely. I don;t know what is my perspective of my hafizh friend at that time, maybe he felt that his voice or beautiful or I understand the ayat. The truth is I have already lost the enjoyment any of things like that. I don't understand the meaning nor I don't find any rhytym is beautiful like I was find at my elementary school. The truth is I missed the moment like that. When I don't know what is the benefit of those kind of things but I could still enjoy it at that time, memorizing Juz 30 and Juz 29, test my memorization to my ustad there, do the halaqoh, make a competition and a little conflict with my junior about silly things like football, girlband, or stupid tools. I missed moments like that. What I have found is rationality is a cursed. It makes me losing the ability to enjoy things like those. This is the truth about why I was crying at that time, but honestly I don't want him to know the truth. There's dilemma in which I need to announce the radical honesty, or I want to fake the worlds that this worlds is amazing, full of bliss, and full of hapiness. I always psyop myself that I need to save this religion so I need to hide my cowardice and hypocrite, but it turns out it never works, then I conclude that I need to destroy any religion, not to preserve anykind. I really hate the song of Imagine all from John Lennon. The pluralism things I hate so much, that they think they could unite people. Heaven and hell might be different, but the most painful things to feel is to burn yourself, to cut yourself. If you haven't felt that things and still consider mental pain is the most painful form of pain, then come to, I'd be happy to make you the most painful experience in this world. And when you lose any kind of hope or purpose when things like that happen through your life, then what is the lesson of torturing eternally. When you never satisfy of the enjoyment you felt, then what is the upper bound of enjoyment that you should really desire. I f all desire is all satisfied, then what kind of repetition that you find amazing. I don't know who I am, I don't know what I want. I want to get rid of people as long as I can because they always force me to feel weak and anxious the moment I mock something they consider as god. God is meant to be mocked, not to be praise or be grateful. When you are grateful for yourself it means you want to make yourself blind of suffering of others, or you're just praying that all of who is suffer should have a fetish of masochism. or in our era of digital where the most 'intellectual' wants us to be surveillenced, one should pray that everyone has a fetish of voyeurism. I can't run from this thought, no matter how hard I try and try to convince myself I need to be as moderate as normal people, that I should be a conformist, but the truth is I can. I don't have aspiration like american dream, varians food to taste, movie to watch, place to visit, people to talk to, friends to play with, I don't desire any of those. What I desire is only the truth, but the truth is ugly that it makes me didn't desire it no more. The simplest thing I want is to let this burden away. I don't care people would remember me, I just want to be free.
