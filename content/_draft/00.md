intro

- i believe data driven society could make world a better place
- contagion ideas i have is economy post scarcity and economic based on donation
- if people behave by incentive, then the currency we have right now is obsolete. people will do everything to get the incentive. most advertisment and social media company driven by interaction and engagement, no matter how destructive itself by some perspectives, it continually incentivize those behaviour. to my mind it's not healthy in the long term. respect might be an alternative currency. 
but it is quite confusing because how we properly incentivize something or someone which deserve an incentive. 
and who are you to judge a content is constructive or destructive?
art itself is hard to valuate. 
what i would like to pursue abstractly is data driven society

A little things are effecting me, I passed zuhr prayer due to irrational thought process. I'm atheist. I'm atheist, I scream to myself. But that scream is usually just a lie. There's always a burden feeling when I missed my prayer. I fucked up my sleep schedule. In Depok I always feel hot and can't sleep early. Sometimes I listen to random youtube videos or audiobook or almatsurat, but it's hard to work for me. I don't want to use air conditioner because of global warming (I'm poor) and electric fan never works. I want places and public transportations like Jakarta with night weather like in Cimahi. A couple of months ago I went to Kuningan, and the air felt so fresh. I could sleep comfortably without air conditioner there. But here in Depok, I hardly fell asleep. I make a schedule that I should sleep at 9 PM, but in the end I just scrolling down twitter or instagram and fell asleep at 1 or 2 AM. I don't know how to fix this. I want to do routine like a Muslim, do tahajud, go to mosque each prayer, even I don't know what things I need to pray. The things I should pray if god exist is I want my family forgets me, that they don't need to remember they got a devil yongest son, so I can kill myself freely. I don't have intention or desire like most people. I gaslight myself that I just want the truth, I don't care about happiness of others or myself, I don't need to be happy, I always convince myself like that. I really hate that I should make a phony talk to my parents. I need to tell them that I healthy when they ask me how is it going. I hate to pretend to laugh when someone talk the jokes I don't understand, but at the same time I need to laugh so they at least have a sensible feeling that they can make other people happy. I really hate that I need hold myself to laugh when someone making dark jones about cripple people, poor people, or someone in a war condition. I want to laugh only when I need to. I remember the moment my friends reciting his quran to rememorizing his quran. I suddenly cried at that, and I think it was the moment when I cried genuinely. I don;t know what is my perspective of my hafizh friend at that time, maybe he felt that his voice or beautiful or I understand the ayat. The truth is I have already lost the enjoyment any of things like that. I don't understand the meaning nor I don't find any rhytym is beautiful like I was find at my elementary school. The truth is I missed the moment like that. When I don't know what is the benefit of those kind of things but I could still enjoy it at that time, memorizing Juz 30 and Juz 29, test my memorization to my ustad there, do the halaqoh, make a competition and a little conflict with my junior about silly things like football, girlband, or stupid tools. I missed moments like that. What I have found is rationality is a cursed. It makes me losing the ability to enjoy things like those. This is the truth about why I was crying at that time, but honestly I don't want him to know the truth. There's dilemma in which I need to announce the radical honesty, or I want to fake the worlds that this worlds is amazing, full of bliss, and full of hapiness. I always psyop myself that I need to save this religion so I need to hide my cowardice and hypocrite, but it turns out it never works, then I conclude that I need to destroy any religion, not to preserve anykind. I really hate the song of Imagine all from John Lennon. The pluralism things I hate so much, that they think they could unite people. Heaven and hell might be different, but the most painful things to feel is to burn yourself, to cut yourself. If you haven't felt that things and still consider mental pain is the most painful form of pain, then come to, I'd be happy to make you the most painful experience in this world. And when you lose any kind of hope or purpose when things like that happen through your life, then what is the lesson of torturing eternally. When you never satisfy of the enjoyment you felt, then what is the upper bound of enjoyment that you should really desire. I f all desire is all satisfied, then what kind of repetition that you find amazing. I don't know who I am, I don't know what I want. I want to get rid of people as long as I can because they always force me to feel weak and anxious the moment I mock something they consider as god. God is meant to be mocked, not to be praise or be grateful. When you are grateful for yourself it means you want to make yourself blind of suffering of others, or you're just praying that all of who is suffer should have a fetish of masochism. or in our era of digital where the most 'intellectual' wants us to be surveillenced, one should pray that everyone has a fetish of voyeurism. I can't run from this thought, no matter how hard I try and try to convince myself I need to be as moderate as normal people, that I should be a conformist, but the truth is I can. I don't have aspiration like american dream, varians food to taste, movie to watch, place to visit, people to talk to, friends to play with, I don't desire any of those. What I desire is only the truth, but the truth is ugly that it makes me didn't desire it no more. The simplest thing I want is to let this burden away. I don't care people would remember me, I just want to be free.

I would really like to kill myself, but I'm just too afraid to do that. I'm a coward, like the great coward. I try to look back what did I do wrong. How can I born into this world. I really want to know what kind of effort that I did in order to reach the ovarium. I'm just a random sperm. I always convince myself that I should enjoy, or even if I can't enjoy, just please feel the sadness and absorb all the mixed feeling about how I'd really like when want to kill myself. I don't care. I don't have any aspiration at all. I'm too dumb to process any of this. This fixed mindset, I always try to open to any experience. But it seems like I don't want to experience any at all. I even have forced myself to let it go. Plesae go, the thought of disappearing and kill myself! Just try to search, to search, and to search. I forced that word to myself. But simply I don't know what I am searching for. Like I don't want to be satified or feel as a whole. I don't know what I am searching for. I don't know what I want. The feeling of this is very much different from what I have been through previously. I was crying and burst a lot of energy, feel so sad and feel sorry for myself, I even regret that I missed the prayer. But right now the feeling of that is no longer happen to me. I don't feel sad or afraid, and I am not afraid of missing all the prayer. I always been taught that hell is terrifying, but the concept of hell now does not make me afraid of it. I just don't understand why I can't believe in all those things anymore. The things that I still afraid is just I am afraid of killing myself, even though that idea is the most ellegant ideas that I find a symbol of braveness, peace, and freedom. But I am just too coward to do that. I don't have intention to enjoy anything. I am not interested in people, or want to try anything. I have comed up to the conclusion that get out of comfortable zone is a lie. Some people just really like to be in a state of chaos and to be challenged. I was an ambitious person who really like challenge, but I realized that it is not a challenge, it's just because I don't know what I need to do, so I need to try to prove to everyone I don't care about. Maybe I need to have sex and get married, try to love again. But I don't really have an interested in understanding others and I don't want to be understood either. Maybe as long as she have sex with me and she has a hobby is enough. And I keep stuck in my room alone to think what this is all about and how to kill myself beautifully. The things is I don't know why I need to support the freedom of random nation, or to oppose to genocide, or to fight bullying. I just don't understand why I should maintain humanity. 

And I remember when yesterday I bought Tahu Gejrot, I suspect the seller seen me as a depressed guy, he tried to entertain me with little talks, "How many chilli do you want?... Would you like me to add the water?. And after he prepared he tried to make a joke, "Pake tahu?". And I just replied in a funny tone, of course I bought tofu, not only buying the water chilli. He replied and said to me just don't be too serious and giggle. I don't understand why we need to make other people smile, why we need to entertain others whenever they are looks sad. Some artists I know, they really want to be depressed so they could create more art. A deep sadness could make you more to be creative and empathetic, so some people really want to sad and depressed, to create something that people can feel, so they feel not alone, and then the creator could feel they they are needed in this world. The circle of nonsense between the creator and the art they created, I just don't understand why. Like we really believe that if a baby is crying, we should stop the crying by provide anything she wants. And whenever they are smiling we feel that it is some kind of achievement like you find the cure of cancer. I just don't understand why people live in automatic way. They create law because law itself doesn't exist. We're just guessing everytime. We don't know anything. And there's so much thing I don't know. I don't have an intention to know all of it. And the process of sesarching, as I said before, I start to question about why do I need to keep searching something I knew that it can't be found. And that something only can be found if I die. And if the end is what's matter, why should I waiting to try to pretend to busy all the time to some people called as improving the world, and they are not improving the world. They just perceived that they have improved the world, while the world it self doesn't tell you that you should improve them. You have no idea what you mean by improving. We always guessing, that improving the world means to make more people happy. But I seem found that the eternal losing gaps between an opposite state is just nonsense, the perfect equilibrium utopia, I don't understand why people strive to do that. Maybe there's something wrong with how I view this world, there might be possibilities so I could try to search again. But I just don't know, whether is nature or nurture, I always being taught and have an instinct to search the fastest path. This is making me perceive myself as a lazy person. But I don't find reason why I need to be busy. Like I don't really want to enjoy. Like this process of writing in the keyboard is I could enjoy at this time. But I always think too far away, because I am afraid of how little preparation at all. Ah... I find the second thing I am afraid, that I don't prepare for something. But it seems like a contradiction. I don't know what should I prepare, and I am just afraid to kill myself. Back again to enjoyment of writing this in a keyboard. I really can imagine where in the future, we don't need to type again. because our brain could be connected to super chip, so it logging anything that we thinks about. It really has a big volume of data I guess, it makes our memory more durable and fault tolerance, we have backup for everything. At that time I lose enjoyment in writing with keyboard as luddite lose enjoyment in using the new tech to work. I can't really imagining that at all. For some it is utopia, but I imagine all of that as hell. Some want their depression to be cured by automation of that tools and drug is more efficient. And everyone can be happy easily. It is the fault of my processing thought that could not be erased, so I would like become the subject of experimentation of that tool, and maybe that they can cure my fault in processing data like that, so I could enjoy searching for something again, maybe they could "cure" me so I can enjoy what I previously enjoy again. And basically they are just erasing me. The "me" who writes like this, that really have a deep interested in killing myself gone. It replaced me to be someone who is productive and make everyone happy. The eeyoore in me is losed, it is not recorded in history or the logs in database of my memory, because the system is design to make me eternally happy, and memories like that are obstacles for reaching their key performance indicator to "cure" me. I don't know who I am anymore, I just happy all the time. This is the thought I haven't found the "cure" if I don't kill myself or I am killed by tools like that that could possibly be build in the future. Then I live happily ever after in jannah and I met the wajh of Allah.

wahai dion, mengapa kau selalu bertingkah seperti bajingan, dengan sangat iseng membuka hansaplas 
orang-orang yang berisikan luka. 

HAHAHA. orang itu saking takutnya melihat luka, mereka cepat-cepat menutup luka mereka dengan hansaplas. 
mereka tidak mengerti lukanya itu sudah kering atau belum, tapi karena saking takutnya mereka melihat luka, 
mereka cepat-cepat menggunakan hansaplas.

mereka tidak tau hansaplasnya itu higienis atau tidak, lukanya sudah kering atau belum. hanya orang tolol yang menggunakan hansaplas di saat lukanya masih basah.

tapi aku tau lukaku sudah kering dan hansaplasnya sudah higienis.

waduh kalo begitu berarti lukamu sudah sembuh, sini biar aku cabut. 

tidaakk!!! sakittt sekalii dasar dion bajingan. mati saja kamu dioonn. 

katanya sudah kering, kok masih sakit. ngapain ditutup2in. 

sini biar aku dekatkan matamu ke luka itu. lihat ini baik2 kontol. kamu itu mirip seperti orang2 takut juga.
berpikir bahwa dengan hansaplas kamu bisa sembuh dari luka. lihat luka itu dalam2, sudah muncul jamur dan bakteri yang lebih ganas seperti kanker. dan bila aku tidak perlihatkan padamu maka itu penyakit itu bisa menyebar dan membunuhmu. maka sekarang pilihannya kuserahkan padamu, kau ingin amputasi penyakitmu itu, atau kau ingin ia bersahabat denganmu dan membuat mu hidup damai selamanya?

bila kupotong kakiku satu, bagaimana aku bisa berdansa dion? lebih baik mati daripada tidak bisa menari. 

kau tidak potong kakimu sekarang pun kau tidak akan bisa menari, tapi dengan satu kaki, kamu bisa mencoba belajar bagaimana caranya menari. lihatlah pesta dansa membosankan itu, semuanya punya 2 kaki, tariannya sama semua. dan bila kau belajar, kau bisa mencipta suatu yang baru. satu kaki yang kuat, yang lincah, coba kau temukan dimana ia. dan aku yakin, kecacatan yang menari itu lebih indah dari apa surga yang dilagukan para pujangga. 

sini aku tambahkan air garam, biar kamu tambah merasakan sakit dari lukanya, ayo rasakan pedihnya. persetan kau mau potong kakimu atau tidak, tapi sebelumnya kau harus jadi lebih sakit dulu. hanya rasa sakit yang bisa membuatmu merasa hidup.

tapi sebelumnya aku punya dua kaki, aku bisa merasakan hidup tanpa rasa sakit, tapi kau membuka luka masa laluku sekarang.

kau pikir para luka dan benalu juga tidak mau hidup? lihatlah, kau mau berdansa seperti para benalu itu? dansa mereka seperti dansanya orang mati, seperti dansanya pelacur di depan pria hidung belang yang niatnya tidak murni, dan pelacur itu hidup apabila ia berdansa karena ia ingin berdansa, bukan karena perlu memenuhi kebutuhan sehari2.

okelah kalau begitu, maka ku akan potong satu kakiku ini, 2 apabila perlu. aku kan mencoba berdansa dengan tangan, dan bila luka menggerogoti tanganku, maka aku dansa dengan kepala, dan bila kepalaku juga kena, aku akan belajar berdansa dengan hati.
sini berikan aku alkohol itu atau obat bius untuk meredakan rasa sakitnya.

tidakkk!!! jangan sampai mabuk, kau nantinya tidak akan bisa menikmati keindahan teriakan para luka itu. kau harus menjadi saksi teriakan mereka, bahwa mereka pun meninginginkan kehidupan. kesakitanmu tidak ada bandingannya dengan mereka yang nantinya akan mati. 

bajingan kau ingin membuatku menderita, sini aku bunuh saja kau agar kau bisa hidup damai selamanya. 

....

Apa? Kau tidak bisa istirahat dengan damai? Bagaimana bisa?
