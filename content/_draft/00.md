- i believe data driven society could make world a better place
- contagion ideas i have is economy post scarcity and economic based on donation
- if people behave by incentive, then the currency we have right now is obsolete. people will do everything to get the incentive. most advertisment and social media company driven by interaction and engagement, no matter how destructive itself by some perspectives, it continually incentivize those behaviour. to my mind it's not healthy in the long term. respect might be an alternative currency. 
but it is quite confusing because how we properly incentivize something or someone which deserve an incentive. 
and who are you to judge a content is constructive or destructive?
art itself is hard to valuate. 
what i would like to pursue abstractly is data driven society

bot answer:

A data-driven society has the potential to bring numerous benefits and contribute to making the world a better place. By utilizing data effectively, we can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions across various sectors, including healthcare, education, transportation, and environmental sustainability.

The idea of an economy post-scarcity is intriguing, where technology and automation have advanced to a level where basic needs can be met for everyone. This could free up resources and allow society to focus on other important aspects, such as personal development, creativity, and pursuing meaningful goals.

An economic system based on donation is another interesting concept. Instead of relying solely on traditional currency, a system that encourages people to contribute and support each other through voluntary giving could foster a more cooperative and compassionate society.

However, the challenge lies in properly incentivizing desirable behavior without compromising ethical values or causing unintended consequences. In the current digital landscape, many platforms and companies thrive on user engagement, often leading to addictive or destructive behaviors. Shifting the focus from engagement to more meaningful interactions and promoting healthy habits is crucial for the long-term well-being of individuals and society.

Finding alternative currencies like respect or other non-material forms of value is an intriguing idea. Valuing constructive contributions, fostering empathy, and encouraging positive interactions can be important steps towards building a more balanced and sustainable society. However, implementing and measuring such currencies can be complex, as the evaluation of constructive or destructive content can be subjective and influenced by individual perspectives.

Art, as you mentioned, is indeed challenging to evaluate. Its value often lies in its subjective interpretation and the emotions it evokes in individuals. Incorporating data-driven approaches in the arts can help understand patterns and preferences, but the true essence and impact of art may transcend quantitative measurements.

In the pursuit of a data-driven society, it's important to strike a balance between data utilization and preserving human values. Transparency, ethics, and inclusivity should be prioritized to ensure that data-driven decisions align with the broader goals of social progress, well-being, and sustainability.
