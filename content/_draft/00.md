intro

- i believe data driven society could make world a better place
- contagion ideas i have is economy post scarcity and economic based on donation
- if people behave by incentive, then the currency we have right now is obsolete. people will do everything to get the incentive. most advertisment and social media company driven by interaction and engagement, no matter how destructive itself by some perspectives, it continually incentivize those behaviour. to my mind it's not healthy in the long term. respect might be an alternative currency. 
but it is quite confusing because how we properly incentivize something or someone which deserve an incentive. 
and who are you to judge a content is constructive or destructive?
art itself is hard to valuate. 
what i would like to pursue abstractly is data driven society

This is worst Ramadhan so far in my life. I lose my faith, I lie to much to myself and my coworkers because my stupidity brings me this meaningless job. 

I get used to not praying. Sometimes I ask myself what is the use of praying. Perhaps my heart has already died, I don't know whether there's a heart respawn or not. I get used to from previous months. Expetations are the worst. I really hate my teachers who said that god is like human, It really liked to be usefull, to be prayed, so ask for more is not a greedy behaviour, but rather a condition which you believe in something superior called god. 

Honestly I don't agree with him, because it contradicts the real life. Maybe it is just because of my disappointment to the omnitent, because I don't get what I want. Or maybe is just human things, we only interact with something as long as we get benefit from it, or they say the worst part is because the things that we are interacted with push away something that give us pain or punishment. 

They say the highest from of interaction is because we love something. We are as human always dicotomize everything. It's easier to think in a sequential way, than think in a more systematic ways of thinking. But always curious and assume that there might be a higher level of thinking, which is not sequential or systematic. Some people said that ony the omnipotent can do thinking with higher level than those. 

Some people say we don't need to try to think in the higher form of way of thinking. And they regard love as the higher form. But what they say is contextual based on what they experience rather than something objective. When you say love, some people regard that as sexual, something that reproduce and make humanity sustain longer. About sustainability, they are all physical and mental, or something spiritual.

You might see my writing is unstructured. But as you see from right now, AI is get easier to make something to be simpler, more efficient, summarize everything in more presice and to the point. And this is what makes me see that something efficient is not human, it is something artifial. 

When I see many people around on the internet become luddite, they even hate and cancel someone who use AI art. We get all these abundances from AI. But see about the responses from a broad of community, they are scared. And they are looking for anyone who as scared as they are. It kinda makes me sad. 

Talking about singularity, it's something that people afraid or embrace. Maybe it still takes a lot of time. But looking at luddite who hate who is using AI artist, it makes me see the depressed history about the industrial revolution. They really need their job so much in order to live. What makes me depressed is I can't relate them too much, because right now I'm living so easy in life, thanks to my dad. But at the same, time I really cursed him because he didn't use condom when he had having sex with my mother. You may say I really hate life my life because I wish hasn't been born before. But no, we can still love life while still wish otherwise. You can't accept contradiction because you still haven't think in a higher level way of thinking.

This is the worst Ramadhan so far. I still can't move on form the past. I know exactly that I am a misserable guy who wish too much from others or myself. But I still don't know which one to blame how my emotion can be easily manipulated, that I end up work in something I really hate or work with someone I don't admire because of fear of something ustable or uncertain. I still find someone to blame who is always making bad decision after all overthingking. Maybe I don't need something to blame, maybe I just need to accept and control it. What past is past, but I still need someone who is responsbile for all bad behaviour, because that is what skin in the game means. 

And one of the bad thing that still happened to me is how I can easily fall for someone I don't really know. This is a first unrequited love I get. I always convince myself, it is better to try than disappointment of never tring, but hell no. If we talk about the number, my success rate of confession is 3/4. It does not include some requited love I got, but unfortunately we end up not dating. If I include that number it will be a 9/10

- lokasi kerja pt econit perkasa beda dengan nama perusahaan sebenarnya, its suspicious.
- semuanya bekerja di 1 meja panjang, tidak ada ruang rapat untuk masing-masing tim atau proyek. 
  - (tolerable?) mungkin yang lainnya sudah terbiasa dengan kondisi itu, tapi saya tidak. 
  - lots of distraction, multi tasking. 
  - that's why i don't comfortable work in office.

- no formal onboarding process
  - no checklist.
  - i just instructed to read the unreadable project reports.
  - they don't have training for new users.

- no knowledge management
  - i ask from beginning to anyone in office, but they don't have any.

- my first request
  - running ookla script
  - i knew my manager has zero knowledge in python

- my first use of VISA
  - i am borrowed account from my college to work on task
  - why i'm in contract but no account for me, its suspicious
  - we work in turns, so there are lots of distractions, and its so stupid

- no ticket management
  - every request is addressed in whatsapp, often they message in no context,
  - my manager can't really define requirement, most of the time he just forward lack of context message from tsel users.
  - from beginning i ask why no task management, my manager said because users don't want to use. i knew it's a lie. i'll explain next section.

- my first meeting with telkomsel users for project introduction
  - its good im late since i dont really involve much there.
  - lots of participants, but most of us are passive

- preparation for second meeting 
  - my manager give services management template for report
  - we are asked to fill the list of our works, complete with time respond, time complete
  - we do're doin it manually look in whatsapp message, imagine the stupid is it, how many lies we make. 

- second meeting with telkomsel users to present what we're working on a couple of last months. 
  - higher manager from telkomsel complaint why in the list they work, the respond time is fast, while the truth is slow.
  - my manager looking for excuses, and users beside tsel higher manager don't complain about the excuses. 
  - tsel higher management ask to use task management from them.
  - my manager said NTI have proper task management.
  - this is how i knew my manager is lying, because their task management is immature. he is not true about users don't like use task management.
  - this is how i knew my manager lack of skills in management. he can't bridge users and engineers well.
    - my manager can't do positive confrontation, bad in reasoning and critical thinking, only a yes-man.
    - his formal writing is bad
    - he can't clarify requirements clearly
    - he don't create template to easier the process of request.
  - like previous meeting, lots of participants, but most of us are passive

- first tutela request
  - i am given access to bigquery
  - first request is from new tsel user
    - semua request dilakukan secara sembarangan dan tidak formal, 
    - engineer sendiri yg perlu menerjemahkan kebutuhan
    - user banyak komplain terkait ketidaksesuaian data, dimana my manager saya kurang bisa mengklarifikasikan requirement secara jelas.
    - user sendiri tidak benar-benar mengetahui data yg dibutuhkannya dan proses pengolahan data. 
    - tidak ada sense of problem dari manager saya terkait hal ini, bukti kurang cakap dalam mendefinisikan masalah.
  - the stupidity is i need to query and download manually periodically, and send it via whatsapp because we're not given servers.
  - saya masih bingung mengapa telkomsel sendiri tidak diberikan akses view terhadap querynya. apakah karena mereka tidak bisa melakukan sql query? hal ini sangat menjengkelkan engineer. tipe pekerjaan yang sebenarnya lebih baik dilakukan secara independen, tapi karena aksesnya terbatas, maka engineer yg perlu melakukan pekerjaan sepele ini. dan biasanya mereka komplain bahwa datanya tidak sesuai, lalu berkali-kali menanyakan query dari data tersebut, kemudian meeting berjam-jam yg mendiskusikan masalah sepele itu.  

-  ookla request:
  - they process things repeatedly, even previously has done before. 
  - this is the drawback of lack of skills in management, unproductive and redundant. 

- we borrow servers from other teams. 
  - how the fuck they easily give me root access.
  - then i use server to process all of it, rebuild custom code from them, install airflow, dbt, experiments much there without my manager know what I'm doing.
  - they must be grateful because i dont run command `sudo rm -f /` there.

- offline meeting with mas ulin
  - i realized that tsel users are not that bright
    - they have many assumptions, lack of clear metholodogy and lack of problem solving skills.
    - they want everything fits with what they want to believe without look at reality.
    - they focus more results, even the results are wrong. 
    - they don't validate query or not even asking about data quality.
    - they just want it looks like it's working.

- i can't respect my manager, but i try
  - my managers ask much, over and over again. ENGINEER IS NOT CUSTOMER SERVICES. 
  - he dont understand what im doing, how he knows value my work and performances?
  - he dont understand technical, sql or programming, even basic statistics.
  - he lack of management skills, what he do is mostly instructs and make excuses.
  - he can't create a colaborative team environment (use git, knowledge management)
  - he can't transparent everything.
    - he said bonus will be given in february, but no explanation until march salary.
    - i knew there are outing budget, but he don't say how much.
  - he always ask to provide data from VISA, to "select *" and then export it to out of VISA to upload to whatsapp. why he don't or can't want even do simple things like that? its so stupid.
  - sometimes random request near midnight
    - ruining my sleep schedule, then im sick

- nti is provide ERP services consultant even when their internal management is fucked up lol
  - grey area in work 24 hours contract, but no compensation.
  - they say their culture is "kekeluargaan", but it's feodalism, with lack of meritocracy.
  - lack of feedback mechanism.
  - lack of skills in information and communication.
    - information about the chart of organization, vision, mission, values, culture, policy. 
    - provide information regard benefits: gym access, sports, community interest, etc.
  - my laptop is broken but no help facility

- my realization
  - saat ini saya sadar, bahwa masalah utama ini hanyalah culture. ini semua kesalahan saya karena tidak bertanya detail saat interview terkait culture perusahaan. 
  - culture vendor BUMN yg saya lihat adalah seperti bermain sumput-sumputan (sembunyi-sembunyi). tidak ada transparansi dalam informasi perusahaan, karena memang begitu budayanya, budaya vendor yg sangat-sangat desperate butuh pekerjaan, sehingga mereka khawatir akan tergantikan apabila client nya mengetahui apa yang diketahuinya. company ini menyedihkan menurut saya. and i feel sorry about that.
