# "Your Anxiety is Telling You the Truth."

- Anxiety is related to freedom, drawing from Kierkegaard's concept of anxiety as the dizziness of freedom, how freedom requires making choices and imposing limitations on oneself.
- The metaphysical aspects of freedom and the experience of looking into the abyss of one's own potential explore the paradoxical nature of freedom, where true freedom is accessed by self-imposed restrictions and limitations.
- Examples of creative expressions, such as music and writing, are used to illustrate the concept of self-imposed limitations leading to artistic success.
- Individuals often realize that once they have complete freedom, they lose the essence of their powers and creative abilities.
- Jack White's music highlights the importance of creating limitations and small rooms for creativity.
- The paradox of freedom is that it is accessed indirectly, requiring limitations.

## Lacan, Freud, and Hegel
- Lacanian theory suggests that anxiety is a mode of truth and arises when we get what we want.
- Lacan argues that desire is insurmountable and essential to our sense of self.
- Freud's theory of anxiety revolves around fear of separation from the object of desire.
- Lacan radicalizes Freud by emphasizing the desire to fight the symbolic father instead of being with the mother.
- Idealism (naive, critical, self-reflective) and materialism are contrasting philosophical approaches.
- Hegelian speculative idealism upends the previous idealist approaches.

## Kant and Christians
- Kantian self-reflective idealism suggests that truth is mediated through conceptual reason.
- Some Christians talk about the freedom they find in being Christian, seeing Christianity as liberating.
- GK Chesterton describes Christianity as an armor that restricts movement but underneath it is unmitigated joy and freedom.
- The crucifixion is seen as liberating people from having to do as God wants.
- In Kantian ethics, the anxiety of existence arises from not knowing what God wants, and belief requires acting as if one knows.
- Idealism upholds the idea of a master in the sky, while materialism transposes this relationship into the world of appearances.

## Psychoanalysis
- In psychoanalysis, the psychoanalyst does not act as a master but as a barrier to communion, allowing the individual to find autonomy and freedom.
- Paying the psychoanalyst is precisely to pay them not to care or appease, but to provide a space for open expression.
- Some people seek substitute father figures in thinkers or public figures, desiring a master who allows them to feel a sense of liberation.
- The psychoanalyst does not give rules or tell people what to do but emphasizes personal responsibility and freedom.
- Impressionism introduced negation and abstraction into art, challenging the traditional depiction of objects and subjects.
- The true master is the one who acts so freely that others recognize their own freedom.

## One piece :v
- Luffy from the manga series "One Piece" exemplifies the Hegelian master, setting others free through his absolute freedom and indifference to societal norms.
- Freedom is contagious, and when we act autonomously and freely, we inspire others to do the same.
- Freedom is not about being better or more successful than others but about doing something that sets others free.
- Embracing the futility of freedom and doing things for their own sake could somehow brings fulfillment.

- Hülderlin suggests that narrative and language mirror the structure of being and the inexpressible.
- Language is excessive and continuously compensates for a lack of accurate communication.
- Poets use language to cut through its form and access deeper meaning.
- Language is not the essence of reality; communication is an ordinary function.
- The opening line of a book is a special and important part of the narrative, representing the implicit contract between the reader and the author.
- In some films, the opening line spoken by a character can summarize the entire movie and hold deeper meaning.
- The concept of a halo, often associated with holiness, represents a line that opens and can take different forms such as circles, squares, or triangles.
- The origin of the word "halo" comes from the idea of hallowed ground, where cattle were led in circular movements to clear the field and create fertility.
- A gravestone marker made for Henry Adams' deceased wife is an ambiguous statue that defies interpretation, withholding meaning and inviting viewer interpretation.
- Withholding meaning can evoke a hunger for interpretation and create a portal between nothingness and being.

# Please compare Žižek with Peter Thiel, each advantage and disadvantages. What things they are agreed on or disagreed.

Hello, dear readers! Today I want to talk about two fascinating and influential thinkers who have very different views on the world: Slavoj Žižek and Peter Thiel. You may have heard of them, or you may not, but I assure you they are worth your attention. In this blog post, I will compare and contrast their ideas, their strengths and weaknesses, and their points of agreement and disagreement. Let's get started!

## Who are they?

Slavoj Žižek is a Slovenian philosopher and cultural theorist who is known for his provocative and often controversial analyses of ideology, politics, culture, psychoanalysis, and pop culture. He is a self-proclaimed Marxist and a critic of capitalism, liberalism, identity politics, and authoritarianism. He has written dozens of books on topics ranging from violence, the global financial crisis, September 11, Christianity, and the pandemic. He is also a popular speaker who has debated with figures such as Jordan Peterson, Richard Dawkins, and Julian Assange.

Peter Thiel is an American entrepreneur and investor who co-founded PayPal and was an early investor in Facebook. He is also a founder of Palantir Technologies, a data analytics company that works with governments and corporations. He is a billionaire with an estimated net worth of nearly $3 billion. He is a political activist who has donated large sums to politicians such as Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. He is a supporter of libertarianism, transhumanism, seasteading, and the Singularity. He is also a controversial figure who has been accused of undermining democracy, journalism, and human rights.

## What are their advantages?

Žižek's main advantage is his ability to challenge conventional wisdom and expose the hidden contradictions and fantasies that shape our reality. He is a master of dialectics, the art of finding the truth through dialogue and conflict. He uses examples from philosophy, literature, cinema, history, and current events to illustrate his points and make them accessible to a wide audience. He is not afraid to question authority, challenge dogma, or offend sensibilities. He is a creative and original thinker who offers new perspectives on old problems.

Thiel's main advantage is his vision and ambition to create a better future through innovation and entrepreneurship. He is a pioneer of the digital revolution who has helped shape the internet as we know it today. He is a leader in the fields of artificial intelligence, biotechnology, space exploration, and cryptocurrency. He is not afraid to take risks, pursue his dreams, or defy conventions. He is a pragmatic and rational thinker who seeks solutions to real-world challenges.

## What are their disadvantages?

Žižek's main disadvantage is his lack of coherence and consistency in his arguments and positions. He often contradicts himself, changes his mind, or makes vague or ambiguous statements. He sometimes resorts to jokes, anecdotes, or personal attacks instead of providing clear evidence or logical reasoning. He sometimes alienates his allies or potential allies by criticizing them harshly or unfairly. He is also accused of being sexist, racist, anti-Semitic, or homophobic by some of his critics.

Thiel's main disadvantage is his lack of empathy and ethics in his actions and decisions. He often disregards the social and environmental consequences of his ventures or investments. He sometimes exploits his power or influence to silence his critics or opponents. He sometimes supports causes or candidates that are harmful to democracy, human rights, or diversity. He is also accused of being elitist, paranoid, or megalomaniacal by some of his detractors.

## What do they agree on?

Despite their many differences, Žižek and Thiel do share some common ground on certain issues. For example:

- They both criticize identity politics as a form of ideological manipulation that divides people into artificial groups based on race, gender, sexuality, or other characteristics.
- They both oppose political correctness as a form of censorship that stifles free speech and open debate.
- They both acknowledge the limitations and failures of liberal democracy as a system that does not represent the interests or aspirations of the majority of people.
- They both recognize the need for radical change in the face of global crises such as climate change, pandemics, terrorism, or inequality.

## What do they disagree on?

However, Žižek and Thiel also have many points of disagreement on fundamental questions such as:

- What is the root cause of the problems we face today? Žižek blames capitalism as an exploitative and oppressive system that creates alienation, injustice, and violence. Thiel blames stagnation as a lack of innovation and progress that creates decay, decline, and despair.
- What is the best way to achieve change? Žižek advocates for collective action and social movements that challenge the existing order and create alternatives. Thiel advocates for individual initiative and entrepreneurial ventures that disrupt the status quo and create value.
- What is the ultimate goal of change? Žižek envisions a communist society that abolishes private property, class divisions, and state power. Thiel envisions a libertarian society that maximizes individual freedom, market competition, and technological advancement.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Žižek and Thiel are two fascinating and influential thinkers who have very different views on the world. They have their advantages and disadvantages, their points of agreement and disagreement. They both offer insights and challenges that can help us understand and improve our reality. I hope you enjoyed this blog post and learned something new. Thank you for reading!
