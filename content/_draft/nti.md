This is my review of working at NTI. Some of it may be harsh, but I'm just expressing how I feel. I apologize if anyone is hurt by my words, but when I voice a complaint, it's not personal; it's because I want everyone to improve and be better. I won't mention anyone's goodness here because I'm focusing solely on my own complaints. I take full responsibility for any faults I may have, and I deeply regret them. However, here's my review of some of the issues I encountered while working at this company. I'll keep it concise so you don't have to spend too much time reading through it.

- Initially, I was informed about the work location, PT Econit Perkasa, which is different from the actual company name. This seemed suspicious to me, but there was no explanation provided.

- Everyone works at a single long table, without separate meeting rooms for each team or project.
  - (Is this tolerable?) Perhaps others are accustomed to this setup, but I am not. 
  - I tried to adapt, but I found it challenging due to the constant distractions and the need for multitasking. Research has shown that multitasking can impair cognitive abilities, which is why I don't feel comfortable working in such an environment.

- Lack of a formal onboarding process:
  - There was no formal onboarding process, including the absence of a checklist.
  - I was simply instructed to read project reports that were often difficult to understand.
  - There was no training provided for new users.

- Absence of knowledge management:
  - Despite seeking guidance from various individuals in the office, I was informed that there was no knowledge management system in place.

- Initial challenges:
  - My first task involved running an Ookla script, despite knowing that my manager had no knowledge of Python.
  - Additionally, for my initial use of VISA, I had to borrow an account from my college to complete the task.
  - The lack of an assigned account for me, despite being under contract, raised suspicions initially.
  - The work environment, where tasks were carried out in shifts, resulted in numerous distractions, which I found counterproductive.

- Absence of ticket management:
  - Requests are handled through WhatsApp, often lacking context.
  - My manager struggles to define requirements, typically forwarding vague messages from Telkomsel users without context.
  - When I inquired about the absence of task management, my manager claimed it was because users preferred not to use it, which I later found to be untrue.

- My first meeting with Telkomsel users for project introduction:
  - It was somewhat fortunate that I was late, as I wasn't heavily involved.
  - Despite numerous participants, most were passive.

- Preparation for the second meeting:
  - My manager provided a template for IT Service Management (ITSM) reports.
  - We were instructed to manually compile lists of our tasks, including response and completion times, based on WhatsApp messages, which was impractical and led to inaccuracies.

- Second meeting with Telkomsel users to present our recent work:
  - A senior Telkomsel manager questioned why our reported response times were fast when in reality, they were slow.
  - My manager attempted to make excuses, which went unchallenged by other users except for the Telkomsel senior manager.
  - The Telkomsel management requested that we use their task management system.
  - Despite my manager's claims of NTI having a proper task management system, it became evident that it was lacking.
  - This highlighted my manager's deficiency in management skills, including the inability to effectively bridge communication between users and engineers:
    - He avoids positive confrontation, lacks reasoning and critical thinking skills, and tends to agree without question.
    - His formal writing skills are inadequate.
    - He struggles to clarify requirements and doesn't create templates to streamline the request process.
  - Similar to previous meetings, there were many participants, but most remained passive.

- First Tutela request:
  - I was granted access to BigQuery for the first Tutela request.
  - The requests were informal and haphazardly made, requiring engineers to interpret the requirements themselves.
  - Telkomsel users frequently complained about data discrepancies due to my manager's inability to clarify requirements clearly.
  - The users themselves often lacked a clear understanding of the data they needed and the data processing procedures.
  - My manager showed a lack of problem-solving skills by not addressing these issues adequately.

  The frustrating aspect was having to manually query and download data periodically, sending it via WhatsApp because we initially lacked server access. I'm still puzzled why Telkomsel wasn't granted direct view access to their queries. Perhaps they lacked SQL query capabilities, which burdened engineers unnecessarily. This type of work would be more efficiently handled independently, but due to restricted access, engineers had to undertake these mundane tasks. Consequently, they often complained about data inaccuracies, leading to lengthy meetings discussing trivial issues.

- Ookla request:
  - There was a tendency to repeat processes, even if they had been done previously.
  - This highlights the drawbacks of inadequate knowledge management skills, resulting in unproductive and redundant work.

- Borrowing servers from NDM teams:
  - It was surprising how easily I was granted root access to borrowed servers.
  - I utilized these servers to process tasks, rebuild custom code, install Airflow, DBT, and conduct various experiments without my manager's awareness.
  - They should be grateful about the fact that I didn't execute commands like 'sudo rm -f /' on those servers.

- Regarding the Telkomsel environment:
  - During an offline meeting with Data Scientist, I came to the realization that Telkomsel users may not possess a high level of aptitude.
    - They often rely on assumptions, lack clear methodologies, and exhibit poor problem-solving skills.
    - There's a tendency to prioritize desired outcomes over reality, without concern for data validation or quality.
    - Their focus is primarily on achieving results, even if those results are questionable or inaccurate.
    - They seem content as long as it appears to be working, without delving into the actual functionality or reliability of the solution.

  - Displeasure with VISA:
    - I developed a strong dislike for VISA due to its sluggish welcome screen, frequent bugs such as long periods of blank screens, and occasional lag even when the connection is stable.

  - Excessive and unproductive meetings:
    - There's been an influx of meetings, often resulting in waiting periods and a significant waste of time.
    - These meetings tend to be unproductive and fail to efficiently address the tasks at hand.

  - They occasionally makes random requests late at night, disrupting my sleep schedule and causing illness.

- Respect towards my manager:
  - Despite my efforts, I struggle to respect my manager due to various reasons.
    - He consistently demands tasks that are outside the realm of an engineer's responsibilities, resembling customer service tasks.
      - For instance, he frequently asks for data from VISA in a simplistic manner, demonstrating a lack of willingness or ability to perform even basic tasks himself.
    - He lacks an understanding of my work, making it difficult for him to appreciate its value or assess my performance, thus failing to respect my contributions.
    - His technical incompetence extends to areas such as SQL, programming, and basic statistics.
    - He lacks crucial management skills, primarily resorting to giving instructions and making excuses rather than effectively leading the team.
    - He appears clueless regarding data governance and fails to foster a collaborative team environment by neglecting tools like Git and knowledge management, leading to single points of failure.
    - Transparency is lacking in his leadership, evident in delayed bonus payments and opaque outing budget allocations.
      - He promised that bonuses would be issued in February, yet as of March, none have been distributed, and there has been no explanation provided for the delay.
    - He fails to conduct retrospective sessions for the team to identify successes, areas for improvement, and priorities.
    - During training events at Telkomsel, his lack of enthusiasm and understanding of his own presentation results in disinterest from the audience.

- Issues within NTI:
  - Despite providing ERP services consultancy, NTI's internal management is flawed.
    - There's ambiguity surrounding the expectations of a 24-hour contract, with an expectation of standby duty without compensation.
    - The company claims to value a familial culture, but it resembles feudalism with a lack of meritocracy.
    - Feedback mechanisms and performance reviews are nonexistent even after 6 months.
    - There's a deficiency in information publication and communication skills, evident in the lack of readily available information about the organization's structure, vision, mission, values, culture, and policies, as well as benefits and facilities such as counseling or sports.
    - When faced with personal issues like a broken laptop or illness, there's a lack of support from the team for me.
    - Expecting a 12-month commitment and penalizing employees who resign prematurely reflects a reliance on punishment rather than creating an environment conducive to long-term employee retention.

- My realization:
    - I've come to understand that the primary issue here lies within the company culture. It's a mistake on my part for not asking detailed questions about the company culture during the interview.
    - The culture within this BUMN vendor appears to be characterized by secrecy and lack of transparency. This is typical of vendors desperate for work, fearing replacement if clients were to discover what they know.
    - It's possible that I'm the only one who perceives many of these issues as problems. If that's the case, then I am mistaken.
    - Perhaps I'm in the minority, similar to in Indonesia's elections, where many are comfortable with the status quo and have no intention of improving or changing. In such cases, the minority must either accept it or move on.
    - Lack of transparency hinders a company's growth, leading to stagnation.
    - This company, in my view, is disheartening, and I feel saddened by it. I sincerely hope that it will improve after I leave.
  
- Why I stop working
  - At the end of my tenure, I chose to demonstrate a disaster management simulation, even though it compromised my integrity. I wanted to take this opportunity to share a scenario that could help avoid such management risks in the future.
  - I believe that knowledge management from the outset, collaboration, transparency, and diversification of resources are crucial. Managers should not only give instructions but also understand what technical staff are doing. If a company cannot handle minor disasters like the one this team experienced, it indicates shortcomings in planning and organizational governance.
  - I hope that with this simulation, the company can improve its management and leadership. It is an opportunity to learn how to manage complex projects more safely in the future.
  - We all need to be prepared for disasters and calamities that can strike at any time. This is a time for reflection, improvement, and joint retrospection.

Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts. I may be bias, but I have no intention of causing harm to anyone; my aim is for better for anyone. Thus, I felt the need to express these sentiments.
  
Thank you once again. So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.
